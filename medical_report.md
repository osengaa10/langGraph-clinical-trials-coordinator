**Patient Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: Not specified
* Gender: Not specified
* ECOG Performance Status: 2 (limited in more strenuous activities due to fatigue and pelvic pain)

**Medical History:**

* Diagnosis: Bladder cancer
* Previous treatments:
	+ Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor
	+ Cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy
	+ Pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression
* Current condition: Disease progression despite previous treatments, with worsening pelvic pain and fatigue

**Current Medications:**

* Not specified, but patient is taking medications for manageable side effects from pembrolizumab immunotherapy (mild joint pain and skin rash)

**Comorbidities:**

* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an eGFR of approximately 45 mL/min, which may impact treatment decisions and clinical trial eligibility

**Current Symptoms:**

* Worsening pelvic pain
* Fatigue
* Mild joint pain
* Skin rash (manageable with medications)

**Imaging Studies:**

* Most recent CT scan (approximately one month ago) showed:
	+ Primary tumor in bladder has increased in size, indicating disease progression
	+ No signs of metastasis to distant organs or lymph nodes
	+ Tumor is still localized to the bladder, but has become more invasive
	+ No metastatic lesions detected in other areas (lungs, liver, bones)

**Laboratory Results:**

* Not specified, but liver function is normal

**Clinical Trial Eligibility Considerations:**

* ECOG performance status of 2 may impact eligibility for certain clinical trials
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an eGFR of approximately 45 mL/min may require careful consideration for treatments that could affect kidney function
* Mild side effects from pembrolizumab immunotherapy (joint pain and skin rash) may require monitoring during future treatments or clinical trials
* Disease progression despite previous treatments, including pembrolizumab immunotherapy, may impact eligibility for certain clinical trials
* Radiation therapy has not been undergone yet and may be a consideration for future treatment

**Recommendations:**

* Consider clinical trials that focus on treatment options for bladder cancer patients with disease progression despite previous treatments, including immunotherapy
* Look for trials that take into account the patient's CKD and ECOG performance status of 2
* Consider trials that offer radiation therapy as a treatment option
* Ensure that the patient's mild side effects from pembrolizumab immunotherapy are monitored and managed during future treatments or clinical trials.
