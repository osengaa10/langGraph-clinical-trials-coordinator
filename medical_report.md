**Patient Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 55 years
* Sex: Male
* Date of birth: [Not provided]

**Medical History:**

* Primary diagnosis: Stage T2 muscle-invasive bladder cancer
* Mutation status: FGFR3 mutation identified
* Previous treatments:
	+ TURBT (Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor) procedure to remove the tumor
* No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy

**Current Symptoms:**

* Mild fatigue
* Pelvic discomfort
* No significant symptoms limiting daily function

**Performance Status:**

* ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score: 1
* Karnofsky score: Not provided

**Medical Conditions:**

* Stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring monitoring
* No cardiovascular disease or other major conditions

**Imaging and Diagnostic Results:**

* CT scans:
	+ Tumor localized to the bladder
	+ No evidence of metastasis to other organs or lymph nodes

**Laboratory Results:**

* FGFR3 mutation status: Positive
* Other relevant lab results: Not provided

**Current Medications:**

* Not provided

**Allergies:**

* Not provided

**Clinical Trial Eligibility Considerations:**

* FGFR-targeted therapy may be a suitable option due to the patient's FGFR3 mutation status
* Close monitoring of kidney function is required due to the patient's CKD
* The patient's ECOG score of 1 indicates a relatively good performance status, which may make them eligible for various clinical trials

**Recommendations:**

* Consider clinical trials investigating FGFR-targeted therapies for muscle-invasive bladder cancer
* Prioritize trials with a focus on patient safety and monitoring of kidney function
* Evaluate the patient's eligibility for trials with a variety of endpoints, including overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rate

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's medical condition, including their diagnosis, treatment history, symptoms, and laboratory results. It highlights the patient's eligibility for clinical trials, particularly those focused on FGFR-targeted therapies for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, while also emphasizing the importance of monitoring their kidney function due to their CKD diagnosis.
