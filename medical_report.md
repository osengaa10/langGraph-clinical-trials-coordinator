**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 58 years old
* Sex: Male

**Medical History:**

* Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with confirmed FGFR3 mutation
* Stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Recent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) procedure to remove the bladder tumor
* No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy

**Current Symptoms and Performance Status:**

* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 1
* Able to perform daily activities with minimal symptoms
* No significant symptoms or complications from the TURBT procedure, with only mild hematuria and urinary discomfort that resolved quickly

**Genetic Testing Results:**

* Confirmed FGFR3 mutation
* No significant PD-L1 expression or elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB)

**Treatment Plan and Preferences:**

* Currently considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to the identified mutation
* Concerns about potential kidney-related side effects due to stage 2 CKD
* Open to FGFR-targeted therapy with manageable side effects and regular monitoring of kidney function
* Interested in exploring clinical trial options for MIBC

**Medications and Allergies:**

* No known allergies or other medical conditions that could impact treatment or interactions with FGFR-targeted therapy
* No current medications that could interact with FGFR-targeted therapy

**Clinical Trial Eligibility:**

* Potential candidate for clinical trials investigating FGFR-targeted therapies for MIBC
* May be eligible for trials evaluating combination therapies or novel agents targeting FGFR3 mutations
* Stage 2 CKD may impact eligibility for trials with nephrotoxic therapies

**Recommendations:**

* Regular monitoring of kidney function and potential kidney-related side effects with FGFR-targeted therapy
* Close monitoring of ECOG performance status and overall health during treatment
* Consideration of clinical trials evaluating FGFR-targeted therapies and combination regimens for MIBC

This report will be used to identify potential clinical trials that align with the patient's medical history, genetic profile, and treatment preferences.
