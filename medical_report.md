**Comprehensive Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 35 years old
* Sex: Female
* Menopausal status: Premenopausal
* BRCA mutation: Positive (germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutation)

**Medical History:**

The patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast in August 2016. The tumor was initially 3.5 cm in size, with two suspicious axillary lymph nodes. A breast MRI revealed a 3.8 cm mass with three pathological appearing lymph nodes. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3, estrogen receptor (ER) positive (>75%), progesterone receptor (PR) positive (1-10%), and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) positive (immunohistochemistry 2+, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positive for amplification).

**Treatment History:**

The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, followed by dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with neulasta support. After completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient underwent bilateral mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy, which revealed residual disease. The patient then initiated adjuvant trastuzumab with plans to continue for 12 months, along with tamoxifen.

**Metastatic Disease:**

The patient developed brain metastases in September 2017, which were treated with gamma knife surgery. Subsequently, the patient developed liver metastasis, which was treated with capecitabine and lapatinib. A liver biopsy revealed metastatic breast cancer, positive for PD-L1. The patient then started experimental pembrolizumab as part of a clinical trial, which led to a complete radiographic response.

**Current Status:**

The patient is currently on pembrolizumab, with a complete response to therapy. The patient has a history of metastatic disease to the brain and liver, and has undergone gamma knife surgery and multiple lines of systemic therapy.

**Molecular Features:**

* ER: Positive (>75%)
* PR: Positive (1-10%)
* HER2: Positive (immunohistochemistry 2+, FISH positive for amplification)
* PD-L1: Positive

**Prior Therapies:**

* Early-stage: THP-ddAC (residual disease)
* Metastatic: T-DM1, pembro (on trial)
* Procedures: Gamma knife to brain metastases

**Clinical Trials Eligibility:**

Based on the patient's medical history, treatment history, and molecular features, the patient may be eligible for clinical trials investigating new therapies for HER2-positive, ER-positive, and PD-L1-positive breast cancer. The patient's complete response to pembrolizumab suggests that immunotherapy may be a viable treatment option. However, the patient's history of brain metastases and liver metastasis may affect eligibility for certain clinical trials.

**Recommendations:**

Further evaluation and consideration for clinical trials should be based on the patient's current disease status, molecular features, and prior therapies. The patient's oncology team should continue to monitor the patient's response to pembrolizumab and consider additional treatment options as needed.
