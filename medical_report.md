**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 49
* Gender: Male

**Medical History:**

* Muscle-invasive bladder cancer, Stage T2 (tumor has invaded the muscle wall of the bladder)
* High-grade tumor (aggressive and more likely to grow and spread)
* Chronic kidney disease, Stage 2 (stable, but requires close monitoring)

**Symptoms:**

* Initial presentation: blood in urine (intermittent, then persistent)
* Discomfort while urinating (dull ache in lower abdomen)
* Urinary urgency (occasionally)
* Symptoms have improved with chemotherapy, but still present

**Treatment History:**

* Chemotherapy (multiple cycles) to shrink the tumor and potentially make surgery more effective
* Currently evaluating response to chemotherapy and discussing next steps (surgery or more intensive treatments)

**Imaging Studies:**

* CT scan: tumor confined to the bladder wall, no evidence of spread to nearby organs or distant lymph nodes
* MRI: confirmed muscle invasion, no clear lymph node involvement or metastasis outside the bladder area

**Surgical Options:**

* Radical cystectomy (removal of the entire bladder) being considered as a potential next step
* Urinary diversion options: ileal conduit (external bag) or neobladder (more natural urination, but with potential challenges)

**Performance Status:**

* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 1 (ambulatory, but restricted in physically strenuous activity)
* Self-reported quality of life: 5/10 (impacted by symptoms and treatment)

**Current Medications:**

* Chemotherapy regimens (specific medications not specified)

**Other Relevant Factors:**

* History of chronic kidney disease, Stage 2, which may impact recovery from cystectomy or affect suitability for certain clinical trials
* Limited by kidney condition, but still exploring clinical trials with neoadjuvant or targeted therapies that could complement current treatment

This report summarizes the patient's medical history, symptoms, treatment history, and current condition. It highlights the importance of considering the patient's chronic kidney disease and performance status when evaluating potential clinical trials.
