**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: [Not specified]
* Sex: [Not specified]
* Diagnosis: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)

**Clinical History:**

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a history of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The patient underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the visible tumor, followed by several cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Initially, the patient responded well to the chemotherapy, but subsequent scans showed residual disease. The patient was then started on pembrolizumab immunotherapy, which provided temporary disease control.

**Current Symptoms:**

The patient is currently experiencing worsening symptoms, including:

* Increased urinary frequency and urgency
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Pelvic pain, worsening at night
* Fatigue, which has significantly impacted daily activities
* Unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the past 2 months
* Decreased appetite and mobility due to pelvic pain

**Performance Status:**

The patient's performance status has declined, with a significant impact on daily activities. The patient has experienced a decline in mobility, requiring more rest and struggling to complete basic tasks.

**Treatment History:**

* TURBT: Completed
* Cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy: Completed
* Pembrolizumab immunotherapy: Currently on treatment, but with evidence of disease progression

**Current Medications:**

* Pembrolizumab
* [Other medications, if applicable]

**Laboratory Results:**

* [Not specified]

**Imaging Results:**

* [Not specified]

**Clinical Trials Considerations:**

The patient is a candidate for clinical trials investigating novel therapies for metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer. Potential areas of interest include:

* Checkpoint inhibitors (other than pembrolizumab)
* Targeted therapies
* Chemotherapy combinations
* Immunotherapy combinations
* Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g., gene therapy, CAR-T cell therapy)

**Recommendations:**

* Consider enrolling the patient in a clinical trial investigating novel therapies for metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer.
* Continue to monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust supportive care as needed.
* Consider consulting with a multidisciplinary team to discuss the patient's care plan and potential treatment options.
