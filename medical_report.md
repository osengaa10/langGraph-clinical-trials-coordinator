**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: [Patient Name]
* Date of Birth: [Patient Date of Birth]
* Age: 49 years old
* Sex: Male

**Medical History:**

* **Primary Diagnosis:** Muscle-invasive bladder cancer
* **Current Treatment Status:** Not currently undergoing active treatment due to disease progression
* **Previous Treatments:**
	+ Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the visible tumor
	+ Cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy (6 cycles)
	+ Pembrolizumab immunotherapy (4 cycles)
* **Genetic and Molecular Profiling:** Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) revealed high PD-L1 expression, but no actionable mutations like FGFR3 or ERBB2 were found
* **Comorbidities:** Chronic kidney disease (CKD), stable but requires close monitoring

**Current Symptoms:**

* Increased urinary frequency and urgency
* Pelvic pain
* Fatigue
* Hematuria (blood in the urine) more frequently in recent weeks
* Weight loss of 10 pounds due to lack of appetite

**Performance Status:**

* ECOG performance status: 2, able to perform basic self-care but limited in more strenuous activities due to fatigue and pain

**Current Medications:**

* None currently, but has undergone previous treatments with cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pembrolizumab

**Laboratory Results:**

* Not available at this time, but previous laboratory results showed high PD-L1 expression in the tumor

**Imaging Results:**

* Recent imaging showed progression of the disease, indicating that pembrolizumab has not been effective in stabilizing the cancer

**Clinical Trial Eligibility:**

* The patient is seeking second-line chemotherapy options and clinical trials, as well as potential targeted therapies based on further genetic testing
* The patient's high PD-L1 expression and lack of actionable mutations make them a candidate for immunotherapy-based clinical trials
* The patient's ECOG performance status and comorbidities, including CKD, should be considered when evaluating clinical trial eligibility

**Recommendations:**

* Further genetic testing, such as FoundationOne testing, may be considered to identify potential targets for treatment or clinical trials
* The patient may be a candidate for clinical trials investigating new immunotherapies or targeted therapies for muscle-invasive bladder cancer
* Close monitoring of the patient's CKD and renal function is recommended when considering treatments that may affect kidney function

**Clinical Trial Search Criteria:**

* Indication: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer
* Stage: Advanced or metastatic
* Previous treatments: Cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pembrolizumab
* Performance status: ECOG 2 or better
* Comorbidities: CKD, stable but requires close monitoring
* Biomarkers: High PD-L1 expression, no actionable mutations like FGFR3 or ERBB2

This report will be used to identify potential clinical trials for the patient, taking into account their medical history, current symptoms, and performance status.
