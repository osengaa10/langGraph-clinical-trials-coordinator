**Medical Report:**

**Patient Profile:**
A 35-year-old premenopausal female with a germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutation, diagnosed with node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) right breast cancer.

**Medical History:**

* August 15, 2016: Patient noticed a palpable right breast mass after breastfeeding.
* September 2, 2016: Diagnostic mammogram revealed a 3.5 cm right breast mass, suspicious for malignancy.
* September 5, 2016: Breast MRI revealed a right breast mass measuring 3.8 cm, along with 3 pathological appearing lymph nodes.
* September 6, 2016: Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the right breast revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3 (of 3), ER+, PR+, and HER2+.
* September 8, 2016: Initial visit with Medical Oncology, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant breast radiotherapy was recommended.

**Treatment History:**

* September 15, 2016: Patient started neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab.
* January 30, 2017: Patient started dose-dense doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide with neulasta support.
* April 20, 2017: Patient underwent bilateral mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy.
* May 15, 2017: Patient initiated adjuvant trastuzumab with plans to continue 12 months of therapy along with tamoxifen.
* July 3, 2017: Patient underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for prophylactic purposes, given BRCA mutation.
* September 26, 2017: Patient underwent gamma knife surgery for two dominant brain metastases.
* October 15, 2017: Systemic therapy changed to ado-trastuzumab emtansine, with discontinuation of the previous plan of completing 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab.
* February 20, 2018: Evidence of liver metastasis, and systemic treatment changed to capecitabine/lapatinib.
* February 25, 2018: Liver biopsy revealed metastatic breast cancer, positive for PDL-1.
* March 1, 2018: Patient started experimental pembrolizumab as part of a clinical trial.

**Current Status:**
The patient has achieved a complete radiographic response to therapy with pembrolizumab, as evidenced by a PET/CT scan after 3 months of treatment.

**Molecular Features:**

* ER+: Estrogen receptor-positive
* PR+: Progesterone receptor-positive
* HER2+: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive
* PD-L1+: Positive for programmed death-ligand 1

**Prior Therapies:**

* Early-stage: THP-ddAC (residual disease)
* Metastatic: T-DM1, pembro (on trial)
* Procedures: Gamma knife to brain metastases

**Sites of Involvement:**

* Brain
* Liver

**Date of Diagnosis:**

* August 2016 (operable)
* September 2017 (metastatic)

**Current Medications:**

* Pembrolizumab (experimental, as part of a clinical trial)

**Recommendations:**
The patient's remarkable response to pembrolizumab suggests that she may be a suitable candidate for further clinical trials investigating the efficacy of immunotherapies in metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, consideration should be given to exploring other targeted therapies, such as those directed against the HER2 pathway, given the patient's HER2-positive status. Ongoing monitoring of the patient's disease status and adjustment of her treatment plan as needed will be crucial in optimizing her outcomes.
