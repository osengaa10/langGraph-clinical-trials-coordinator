**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 35 years old
* Sex: Female
* Menopausal status: Premenopausal
* BRCA mutation: Positive (germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutation)

**Cancer Diagnosis:**

* Primary cancer: Invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast
* Date of diagnosis: August 2016 (operable), September 2017 (metastatic)
* Cancer stage: Initially operable, later metastatic
* Sites of involvement: Brain, liver, and bones
* Molecular features: Estrogen receptor (ER) positive (>75%), progesterone receptor (PR) positive (1-10%), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive, and PD-L1 positive

**Treatment History:**

* Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, followed by dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with neulasta support
* Surgery: Bilateral mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy
* Adjuvant therapy: Trastuzumab and tamoxifen
* Metastatic treatment:
	+ Ado-trastuzumab emtansine
	+ Capecitabine and lapatinib
	+ Pembrolizumab (as part of a clinical trial)
* Procedures: Gamma knife surgery for brain metastases, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for prophylactic purposes

**Current Status:**

* The patient is currently on pembrolizumab, which has resulted in a complete radiographic response to therapy.
* The patient has a history of metastatic disease to the brain, liver, and bones.

**Relevant Factors for Clinical Trial Eligibility:**

* BRCA mutation status: Positive
* ER, PR, and HER2 status: Positive
* PD-L1 status: Positive
* Prior therapies: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant therapy, and metastatic treatments (including ado-trastuzumab emtansine, capecitabine and lapatinib, and pembrolizumab)
* Current performance status: Not specified
* Any comorbidities or concurrent medications that may impact clinical trial eligibility: Not specified

**Recommendations for Clinical Trials:**

* Based on the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer, BRCA mutation, and response to pembrolizumab, clinical trials investigating immunotherapies, targeted therapies, or combination regimens may be suitable.
* Trials focusing on brain metastases, liver metastases, or bone metastases may also be relevant.
* The patient's PD-L1 positive status and prior response to pembrolizumab make her a potential candidate for clinical trials investigating checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapies.
