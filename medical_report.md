**Medical Report:**

**Patient Profile:**
The patient is a 35-year-old premenopausal female with a diagnosed BRCA1 mutation, which confirms a hereditary breast cancer predisposition syndrome.

**Medical History:**
The patient was initially diagnosed with a 3.5 cm right breast mass in August 2016. Diagnostic tests, including mammogram, ultrasound, and breast MRI, revealed a suspicious mass and axillary lymph nodes, concerning for metastatic involvement. A biopsy confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3, with estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) positive.

**Treatment History:**
The patient has undergone the following treatments:

1. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (September 2016)
2. Dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with neulasta support (January 2017)
3. Bilateral mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (April 2017)
4. Adjuvant trastuzumab with plans to continue 12 months of therapy along with tamoxifen (May 2017)
5. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for prophylactic purposes (July 2017)
6. Gamma knife surgery for brain metastases (September 2017)
7. Systemic therapy changed to ado-trastuzumab emtansine (October 2017)
8. Capecitabine/lapatinib due to liver metastasis (February 2018)
9. Experimental pembrolizumab as part of a clinical trial (March 2018)

**Current Status:**
The patient has achieved a complete radiographic response to therapy with pembrolizumab, as evidenced by a PET/CT scan after 3 months of treatment.

**Relevant Details:**

* **Symptoms:** Severe headaches and nausea (September 2017)
* **Medical History:** BRCA1 mutation, hereditary breast cancer predisposition syndrome
* **Current Medications:** Pembrolizumab
* **Molecular Features:** ER+, PR+, HER2+, PD-L1+
* **Prior Therapies:** THP-ddAC, T-DM1, pembro (on trial)
* **Procedures:** Gamma knife to brain metastases
* **Sites of Involvement:** Brain, liver
* **Date of Diagnosis:** August 2016 (operable); September 2017 (metastatic)

**Clinical Trial Eligibility:**
The patient's comprehensive medical history, treatment regimen, and molecular features make her an ideal candidate for clinical trials focusing on HER2-positive, ER-positive, and PD-L1-positive breast cancer, particularly those investigating innovative therapies for brain and liver metastases. Her response to pembrolizumab and prior treatments will be crucial in determining the best clinical trial options.
