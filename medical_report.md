**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: [Not specified]
* Sex: [Not specified]
* Diagnosis: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)

**Clinical History:**

The patient is a [age]-year-old individual with a diagnosis of MIBC, classified as stage T2, with high PD-L1 expression and no FGFR3 mutations. The patient initially underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the visible tumor, followed by chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine. Currently, the patient is receiving pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression.

**Treatment History:**

* TURBT: [Date]
* Chemotherapy (cisplatin and gemcitabine): [Date]
* Pembrolizumab immunotherapy: Ongoing

**Current Response to Treatment:**

The patient has shown stable disease with pembrolizumab immunotherapy, with the most recent CT scan (conducted approximately 2 months into treatment) showing no significant growth or spread of the tumor. The cancer has not shrunk substantially, but it also has not progressed.

**Symptoms and Performance Status:**

The patient experiences urinary symptoms, including frequency and urgency, which have improved slightly since starting pembrolizumab. The patient also experiences mild neuropathy and joint pain, controlled with medications. The patient's ECOG performance status is 1, indicating they can perform most daily activities with some limitations.

**Biomarkers and Molecular Testing:**

* PD-L1 expression: High
* FGFR3 mutations: Negative

**Treatment Preferences:**

The patient prefers a bladder-sparing approach for as long as it remains a viable option and prioritizes quality of life. The patient is open to exploring clinical trials and is willing to travel for treatment if necessary.

**Relevant Comorbidities:**

None significant, except for mild neuropathy and joint pain controlled with medications.

**Recommendations for Clinical Trials:**

Based on the patient's current response to pembrolizumab and treatment preferences, we recommend considering clinical trials that:

1. Investigate combination therapies that may enhance the effectiveness of pembrolizumab.
2. Evaluate novel bladder-sparing treatments that prioritize quality of life.
3. Explore biomarker-driven approaches that may identify new targets for therapy.

**Potential Clinical Trials:**

* Combination immunotherapy trials (e.g., pembrolizumab + other checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies)
* Novel bladder-sparing treatment trials (e.g., new chemotherapies or radiation therapies)
* Biomarker-driven trials (e.g., identifying new targets for therapy based on molecular testing)

**Conclusion:**

The patient is a suitable candidate for clinical trials that investigate novel treatments for MIBC, prioritizing bladder-sparing approaches and quality of life. Further evaluation and discussion with the patient's healthcare team will be necessary to determine the best course of action and identify potential clinical trials.
