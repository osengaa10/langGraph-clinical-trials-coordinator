**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 49 years
* Sex: Male
* Diagnosis: Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIUC) with high PD-L1 expression

**Current Treatment:**

* Pembrolizumab (immunotherapy) for approximately several months
* Previous treatments:
	+ Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT)
	+ Chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine

**Disease Status:**

* Stable disease with no significant progression since starting pembrolizumab
* CT scan 2 months ago showed stable disease with no signs of metastasis to other organs or lymph nodes

**Symptoms and Quality of Life:**

* Mild fatigue and joint pain manageable with over-the-counter medications
* Urinary symptoms (frequency and urgency) stable, with occasional nighttime disruptions
* Hematuria (blood in urine) significantly improved since starting treatment
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with stable kidney function and creatinine levels

**Tumor Characteristics:**

* Pure urothelial carcinoma with no additional histological components
* High PD-L1 expression

**Performance Status:**

* ECOG status of 1

**Prognosis and Life Expectancy:**

* Uncertain, but current treatments are controlling the disease
* No specific life expectancy provided due to the variable nature of the disease

**Treatment Goals and Preferences:**

* Priority on maintaining a good quality of life while staying proactive with effective treatments
* Open to exploring new options and clinical trials if needed, with a focus on balancing efficacy and minimizing side effects

**Recommendations for Clinical Trials:**

* Consider trials that focus on immunotherapy combinations or novel agents for muscle-invasive bladder cancer
* Trials that prioritize patient quality of life and minimize side effects
* Considerations for trials that may offer alternative treatment options for patients with stable disease on pembrolizumab

**Potential Trial Inclusion Criteria:**

* Muscle-invasive bladder cancer with high PD-L1 expression
* Stable disease on pembrolizumab
* ECOG status of 0-1
* Adequate kidney function and creatinine levels
* No significant comorbidities or contraindications to trial treatments

**Potential Trial Exclusion Criteria:**

* Active or prior autoimmune disorders
* Prior or concurrent malignancies
* Uncontrolled infections or medical conditions
* Known hypersensitivity to trial treatments
