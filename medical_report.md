**Medical Report:**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: [Not Provided]
* Age: 49 years old
* Sex: Male

**Chief Complaint:**

* Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with disease progression despite standard treatments.

**Medical History:**

* Diagnosis: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer, stage T2, high-grade
* Initial treatment: Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy
* Subsequent treatment: Pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression
* Disease progression despite above treatments
* No history of radiation therapy

**Current Symptoms:**

* Fatigue
* Pelvic pain

**Performance Status:**

* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score: 2, indicating ability to handle basic self-care but limited in more strenuous activities due to fatigue and pelvic pain.

**Comorbidities:**

* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of approximately 45 mL/min
* No significant allergies or other comorbidities, such as liver disease or heart conditions.

**Recent Diagnostic Tests:**

* CT scan (approximately one month ago) showing:
	+ Progression of the primary tumor in the bladder
	+ No evidence of metastasis to other organs or distant sites
	+ No new metastases or tumor sites outside the bladder

**Current Medications:**

* None mentioned, but patient has received pembrolizumab immunotherapy in the past.

**Clinical Trial Eligibility Considerations:**

* Patient is open to participating in clinical trials that can improve prognosis
* Patient has a history of CKD, which may impact eligibility for certain trials, especially those involving nephrotoxic treatments.
* Patient's ECOG performance status of 2 may impact eligibility for trials requiring more strenuous activities.

**Recommendations for Clinical Trials:**

* Trials evaluating novel treatments for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, such as targeted therapies, CAR-T cell therapy, or combination immunotherapies
* Trials with a focus on patients with CKD or impaired renal function, to ensure safety and efficacy in this population
* Trials with a focus on patients with ECOG performance status 2, to ensure feasibility and tolerability in this population.

**Conclusion:**

The patient is a 49-year-old male with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, stage T2, high-grade, who has progressed despite standard treatments. He has a history of CKD and an ECOG performance status of 2, which may impact his eligibility for certain clinical trials. The patient is open to participating in clinical trials that can improve his prognosis. Further evaluation and discussion with a medical oncologist or urologic oncologist are recommended to determine the best course of treatment and potential clinical trial options.
