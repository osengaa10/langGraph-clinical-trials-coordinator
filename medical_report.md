**Medical Report**

**Patient Information**

* Name: [Patient's Name]
* Age: 50 years
* Sex: Male
* Medical Record Number: [Insert Record Number]

**Medical History**

* Diagnosis: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), Stage T2, high-grade
* Initial Treatment:
	+ Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor
	+ Cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy
	+ Pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression
* Progression: Recent imaging showed cancer progression despite previous treatments
* Comorbidities:
	+ Chronic kidney disease (CKD), stable but requiring regular monitoring

**Current Symptoms and Side Effects**

* Fatigue, persistent since chemotherapy
* Mild peripheral neuropathy (tingling in hands and feet) since chemotherapy
* Mild joint pain and skin rash during pembrolizumab immunotherapy, controlled with medications

**Medical Conditions Requiring Ongoing Management**

* Chronic kidney disease (CKD): stable, with regular monitoring of creatinine levels

**Current Medications**

* Not specified, but previous treatments included cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pembrolizumab
* Medications for managing side effects, such as those for joint pain and skin rash

**Laboratory and Imaging Results**

* Recent imaging showed cancer progression
* Creatinine levels are closely monitored due to CKD
* PD-L1 expression is high

**Genetic Testing**

* No specific genetic mutations mentioned, but the patient is interested in exploring targeted therapies based on further genetic testing

**Clinical Trial Eligibility**

* The patient is interested in exploring clinical trials with targeted therapies, combination regimens, and CAR-T cell therapy
* Eligibility for clinical trials may be limited by CKD and previous treatments

**Recommended Clinical Trials**

* Targeted therapy trials, especially those focusing on genetic mutations not yet identified in this patient
* Combination regimens, including immunotherapy with chemotherapy or other agents
* CAR-T cell therapy trials, although these may be more experimental for solid tumors like bladder cancer

**Special Considerations**

* The patient's CKD requires careful monitoring and management to ensure that any future treatments do not exacerbate kidney function
* The patient's previous treatments and side effects should be taken into account when considering new treatments and clinical trials

This medical report provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's condition, medical history, and current symptoms. It highlights the patient's interest in exploring clinical trials with targeted therapies, combination regimens, and CAR-T cell therapy. The report also emphasizes the importance of considering the patient's CKD and previous treatments when evaluating eligibility for clinical trials.
