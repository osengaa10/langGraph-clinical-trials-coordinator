**MEDICAL REPORT**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 35 years old
- Sex: Female
- Premenopausal status

**Medical History:**
- Diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma on September 6, 2016
- Confirmed BRCA1 mutation, indicating a hereditary breast cancer predisposition syndrome
- Initial treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab) followed by dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
- Bilateral mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on April 20, 2017
- Adjuvant trastuzumab and tamoxifen initiated on May 15, 2017
- Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed on July 3, 2017, for prophylactic purposes
- Developed brain metastases on September 23, 2017, and underwent gamma knife surgery on September 30, 2017
- Systemic therapy changed to ado-trastuzumab emtansine on October 15, 2017
- Discontinued ado-trastuzumab emtansine and initiated capecitabine/lapatinib on February 20, 2018
- Started experimental pembrolizumab on March 1, 2018, as part of a clinical trial
- Experienced complete radiographic response to pembrolizumab on June 15, 2018

**Current Status:**
- Diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer to the brain and liver
- ER+, PR+, HER2+, and PD-L1+ disease
- Currently on pembrolizumab with a complete response

**Clinical Trials Eligibility:**
- The patient's BRCA1 mutation, HER2+, and PD-L1+ status may make her eligible for clinical trials targeting these biomarkers.
- Her complete response to pembrolizumab suggests potential eligibility for trials investigating immunotherapy combinations.
- Previous treatment with ado-trastuzumab emtansine and capecitabine/lapatinib may limit eligibility for trials involving similar agents.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue pembrolizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
- Consider enrolling in clinical trials investigating novel immunotherapy combinations or targeted therapies addressing the patient's specific biomarkers.
- Regularly monitor for disease progression and adjust treatment accordingly.

**Medications:**
- Pembrolizumab (immunotherapy)
- Previous medications: paclitaxel, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, capecitabine, lapatinib, tamoxifen

**Procedures:**
- Gamma knife surgery to brain metastases
- Bilateral mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy
- Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

**Lab Results:**
- ER+ (>75%)
- PR+ (1-10%)
- HER2+ (immunohistochemistry 2+, FISH positive for amplification)
- PD-L1+ (liver biopsy)

**Imaging Studies:**
- Mammogram (September 2, 2016): 3.5 cm right breast mass suspicious for malignancy
- Axillary ultrasound (September 2, 2016): two suspicious axillary lymph nodes
- Breast MRI (September 5, 2016): 3.8 cm right breast mass and three pathological appearing lymph nodes
- Brain MRI (September 25, 2017): two dominant brain metastases
- PET/CT scan (June 15, 2018): complete radiographic response to pembrolizumab
