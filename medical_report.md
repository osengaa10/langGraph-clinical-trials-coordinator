**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 50 years
* Sex: Male

**Chief Complaint and Medical History:**

* Diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with a tumor classification of T2 and high-grade histology.
* The patient underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor, but has not received any chemotherapy or radiation therapy to date.
* Molecular testing revealed the presence of an FGFR3 point mutation, which may impact treatment options and clinical trial eligibility.

**Current Symptoms and Performance Status:**

* The patient reports minimal symptoms and only slight limitations in daily activities, corresponding to an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1.

**Co-Morbidities:**

* Stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which may impact the patient's eligibility for certain clinical trials, particularly those involving nephrotoxic treatments.

**Current Medications:**

* None that may interfere with potential trial therapies.

**Relevant Laboratory Results:**

* Molecular testing confirmed the presence of an FGFR3 point mutation.

**Clinical Trial Eligibility Considerations:**

* The patient's FGFR3 mutation may make them eligible for clinical trials investigating FGFR-targeted therapies.
* The patient's stage 2 CKD may require careful consideration of trial therapies and monitoring of renal function.
* The patient's ECOG performance status of 1 indicates that they are relatively healthy and may be eligible for a range of clinical trials.

**Recommended Clinical Trial Categories:**

* FGFR-targeted therapy trials for patients with MIBC and FGFR3 mutations.
* Trials investigating novel combination therapies for MIBC, including immunotherapy and targeted therapies.
* Trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of new treatments for MIBC in patients with compromised renal function.

This report provides a comprehensive summary of the patient's medical condition and is intended to facilitate the identification of suitable clinical trials.
