* PD-L1 positive (as per liver biopsy)

**Imaging Results:**

* Mammogram (September 2, 2016): 3.5 cm right breast mass, suspicious for malignancy
* Axillary ultrasound (September 2, 2016): 2 suspicious axillary lymph nodes, concerning for metastatic involvement
* Breast MRI (September 5, 2016): 3.8 cm right breast mass, along with 3 pathological appearing lymph nodes

**Clinical Trials Eligibility:**

* Metastatic breast cancer with brain and liver involvement

* Adjuvant trastuzumab and tamoxifen
* Gamma knife surgery for brain metastases
* Experimental pembrolizumab as part of a clinical trial for metastatic disease

**Follow-up:**

* Regular follow-up with Medical Oncology for monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy
* Consideration for future clinical trials based on disease progression and response to therapy
