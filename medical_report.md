**Medical Report**

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 49
* Sex: Male
* Diagnosis: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)

**Medical History:**

* Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) for initial tumor removal
* Completed cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, with partial response
* Received pembrolizumab immunotherapy, with disease progression
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 3, with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45 mL/min/1.73 m²

**Current Symptoms:**

* Worsening urinary symptoms, including increased frequency, urgency, and hematuria (blood in urine)
* Pelvic pain, with dull ache and sharp exacerbations, especially with urination
* Fatigue, weight loss (10 lbs), and limited mobility due to pelvic pain

**Performance Status:**

* Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score: 70 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to carry on normal activity or do work)
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 2 (ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities)

**Laboratory Results:**

* eGFR: 45 mL/min/1.73 m²
* Creatinine: [insert value]
* Hemoglobin: [insert value]
* White blood cell count: [insert value]
* Platelet count: [insert value]

**Imaging Studies:**

* No evidence of metastatic disease to other organs, including lymph nodes, bones, and other visceral organs

**Treatment History:**

* Cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy: completed with partial response
* Pembrolizumab immunotherapy: disease progression
* Radiation therapy: not received

**Eligibility for Clinical Trials:**

* May be eligible for clinical trials that do not require high kidney function or nephrotoxic treatments
* May be eligible for clinical trials that focus on symptom management and quality of life improvement
* May be eligible for clinical trials that investigate novel therapies for MIBC, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies

**Recommendations:**

* Consider enrolling in clinical trials that focus on symptom management and quality of life improvement
* Consider enrolling in clinical trials that investigate novel therapies for MIBC
* Continue to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment plan as necessary to minimize risk of kidney damage

**Next Steps:**

* Discuss clinical trial options with the patient and obtain informed consent
* Coordinate with other healthcare providers to ensure continuity of care and communication
* Monitor patient's condition and adjust treatment plan as necessary
