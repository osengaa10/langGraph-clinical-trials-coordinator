* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with stable renal function

**Current Treatment:**

* Pembrolizumab immunotherapy (ongoing)
* Previous treatment:
	+ Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT)
	+ Cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy

* Eligible for trials with a focus on managing treatment side effects or improving quality of life

**Willingness to Provide Samples:**

* Willing to provide FFPE tumor tissue sample from previous surgery
* Willing to provide blood samples as required for clinical trial protocols

**Recommendations:**

* Continue monitoring response to pembrolizumab immunotherapy and adjust treatment plan as necessary

* Address patient concerns and fears through ongoing education and support
* Encourage patient participation in clinical trials that align with their treatment goals and preferences.
