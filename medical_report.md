**Medical Report:**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: [Not Provided]
* Date of Birth: [Not Provided]
* Age: 49
* Gender: Male

**Chief Complaint:**

* Muscle-invasive bladder cancer, diagnosed with stage T2 disease

**Medical History:**

* Muscle-invasive bladder cancer, diagnosed with stage T2 disease
* Stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Recent TURBT procedure to remove the tumor
* No cardiac issues or other major underlying conditions

**Current Medications:**

* None mentioned

**Genetic Testing and Molecular Profiling:**

* Confirmed FGFR3 mutation in the tumor

**Imaging Studies:**

* Recent CT scans showed localized disease to the bladder with no involvement of lymph nodes or other organs

**Treatment History:**

* TURBT procedure to remove the tumor
* Considering FGFR-targeted therapies, specifically erdafitinib, due to FGFR3 mutation
* No chemotherapy or radiation therapy received to date

**Clinical Trial Eligibility Considerations:**

* Stage 2 CKD may impact eligibility for certain trials, especially those involving nephrotoxic treatments
* FGFR3 mutation may be a relevant inclusion criterion for certain trials
* Recent imaging studies showing localized disease may be relevant for trials focusing on organ-confined disease

**Patient Preferences:**

* Primary concerns are quality of life and managing potential side effects, especially considering stage 2 CKD
* Open to options that offer effective control of the cancer with minimal impact on kidney function and overall daily living

**Relevant Clinical Trials:**

* Trials investigating FGFR-targeted therapies, such as erdafitinib, in patients with FGFR3-mutated bladder cancer
* Trials focusing on organ-confined disease, given the patient's localized disease status
* Trials with a focus on minimizing nephrotoxicity and preserving kidney function in patients with pre-existing CKD

**Recommendations:**

* Continue to evaluate the patient's eligibility for clinical trials investigating FGFR-targeted therapies and other relevant treatment options
* Consider trials with a focus on minimizing nephrotoxicity and preserving kidney function in patients with pre-existing CKD
* Prioritize the patient's quality of life and management of potential side effects in the selection of clinical trials and treatment options.
