**Kidney Function:**

* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR): 60-70 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²
* Stage 2 chronic kidney disease
* Closely monitored for potential kidney damage or dysfunction due to cisplatin-based chemotherapy

**Current Medications:**

* Cisplatin-based chemotherapy

**Clinical Trial Eligibility:**

* Potential candidate for immunotherapy trials due to moderate PD-L1 expression
* May be eligible for targeted therapy trials if further molecular testing identifies relevant mutations or alterations

**Recommendations:**

* Continue close monitoring of kidney function to prevent potential decline
