**Patient Information:**

* Age: 48 years
* Sex: Male
* Date of Birth: [Not Provided]
* Medical Record Number: [Not Provided]

**Chief Complaint:**

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, currently experiencing worsening symptoms and disease progression despite prior treatments.

**Medical History:**

* Diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, stage T2, high-grade
* Underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor
* Received cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy
* Started pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression
* Disease progression identified on CT scan approximately one month ago, with increased size of the primary bladder tumor and no evidence of new metastases or distant spread

**Current Symptoms:**

* Worsening pelvic pain
* More frequent episodes of hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Increased urinary urgency
* Intensified fatigue, affecting daily activities

**Performance Status:**

* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 2

**Comorbidities:**

* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of approximately 45 mL/min

**Current Medications:**

* Pembrolizumab (immunotherapy)
* [No other medications mentioned]

**Laboratory Results:**

* eGFR: 45 mL/min
* [No other laboratory results provided]

**Tumor Characteristics:**

* Stage: T2
* Grade: High-grade
* PD-L1 expression: High

**Treatment History:**

* TURBT
* Cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy
* Pembrolizumab immunotherapy

**Clinical Trial Eligibility Considerations:**

* CKD with eGFR of 45 mL/min may impact eligibility for certain clinical trials, especially those involving nephrotoxic treatments
* Prior treatment with pembrolizumab may impact eligibility for clinical trials involving other checkpoint inhibitors
* Disease progression and current symptoms may impact eligibility for clinical trials with specific inclusion criteria

**Recommendations:**

* Consider clinical trials for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, taking into account the patient's prior treatment history, CKD, and current symptoms
* Evaluate the patient's eligibility for clinical trials with novel therapeutic agents, such as targeted therapies or combination regimens
* Prioritize clinical trials with minimal nephrotoxicity to minimize the risk of further renal impairment
