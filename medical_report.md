**Medical Report:**

**Patient Profile:**
The patient is a 35-year-old premenopausal female with a diagnosis of breast cancer. She has a germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutation, confirming a hereditary breast cancer predisposition syndrome.

**Medical History:**
The patient's oncologic history is as follows:
- August 15, 2016: Noticing a palpable right breast mass after breastfeeding.
- September 2, 2016: Diagnostic mammogram and axillary ultrasound revealed a 3.5 cm right breast mass and two suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
- September 5, 2016: Breast MRI confirmed a 3.8 cm right breast mass and three pathological appearing lymph nodes.
- September 6, 2016: Biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3, ER positive (>75%), PR positive (1-10%), and HER2 positive (IHC 2+, FISH positive for amplification).
- September 8, 2016: Initial visit with Medical Oncology, recommending neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant breast radiotherapy.
- The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, followed by dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.
- February 2, 2017: A comprehensive hereditary breast cancer panel confirmed a germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutation.
- April 20, 2017: Bilateral mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy showed residual 0.5 cm right breast carcinoma with evidence of treatment effect and 1 out of 23 lymph nodes with metastatic disease.
- May 15, 2017: Initiated adjuvant trastuzumab with plans for 12 months of therapy along with tamoxifen.
- July 3, 2017: Underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for prophylactic purposes due to the BRCA mutation.
- September 25, 2017: Brain MRI revealed two dominant brain metastases, treated with gamma knife surgery.
- October 15, 2017: Systemic therapy changed to ado-trastuzumab emtansine due to brain metastases.
- February 20, 2018: Evidence of liver metastasis led to the discontinuation of ado-trastuzumab emtansine and the initiation of capecitabine/lapatinib.
- February 25, 2018: Liver biopsy confirmed metastatic breast cancer, positive for PDL-1.
- March 1, 2018: Progressive disease in the liver and bones led to the discontinuation of capecitabine/lapatinib and the initiation of experimental pembrolizumab as part of a clinical trial.

**Current Status:**
As of June 15, 2018, the patient has shown a complete radiographic response to pembrolizumab therapy.

**Clinical Trials Eligibility:**
Given the patient's history and current status, she may be eligible for clinical trials focusing on:
- HER2-positive breast cancer treatments
- BRCA1 mutation-related therapies
- PDL-1 positive breast cancer treatments
- Brain and liver metastasis management in breast cancer
- Immunotherapy trials, particularly those involving pembrolizumab or similar agents

**Key Details for Clinical Trials:**
- Age: 35 years old
- Premenopausal status

- Node-positive, ER+, HER2+ right breast cancer
- Prior therapies: THP-ddAC, T-DM1, pembrolizumab
- Procedures: Gamma knife surgery for brain metastases
- Current therapy: Pembrolizumab as part of a clinical trial
- Sites of involvement: Brain, liver
- Molecular features: ER+, PR+, HER2+, PD-L1+

This medical report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the patient's condition, treatment history, and current status to facilitate the identification of suitable clinical trials that may offer additional therapeutic options.
