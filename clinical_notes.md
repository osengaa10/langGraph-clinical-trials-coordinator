A 35-year-old premenopausal female  with recently diagnosed  breast cancer presents today for 
recommendations regarding treatment. Her oncologic history is as follows:
1.August 15, 2016: patient noticed a palpable right breast mass after breastfeeding.
2.September 2, 2016: patient sought medical attention for the breast mass. Diagnostic 
mammogram revealed a  3.5 cm right breast mass, suspicious for malignancy. Axillary 
ultrasound revealed two suspicious axillary lymph nodes, concerning for metastatic 
involvement.
3.September 5, 2016: breast MRI revealed a right breast mass measuring 3.8 cm, along with  3 
pathological appearing lymph nodes.
4.September 6, 2016: Ultrasound-guided  biopsy of the right breast  reveals an invasive 
ductal carcinoma, Nothingam grade 3 (of 3), estrogen receptor (ER) positive ( ER >75%), 
progesterone receptor (PR) positive ( PR 1-10%), human epidermal growth receptor 
2 (HER-2) positive (immunohistochemistry 2+, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
positive for amplification.  Biopsy of right axillary lymph node  reveals evidence 
for metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with breast primary.
5.September 8, 2016: initial visit with Medical Oncology. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
followed by surgery and adjuvant breast radiotherapy is recommended.
6.September 15, 2016: patient  starts neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, 
trastuzumab, and pertuzumab .
7.January 30, 2017: patient starts  dose-dense doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide  with neulasta 
support.
8.February 2, 2017: comprehensive hereditary breast cancer panel reveals a  germline 
pathogenic BRCA1 mutation, confirming a hereditary breast cancer predisposition 
syndrome.
9.April 20, 2017: patient undergoes  bilateral mastectomy  with right axillary sentinel lymph 
node biopsy. Breast pathology specimen reveals a  residual 0.5 cm right breast 
carcinoma, 43% cellularity, with evidence of treatment effect, and  1 out of 23 lymph 
nodes with evidence of metastatic disease . Left breast shows only benign parenchyma.
10.May 15, 2017: patient initiates  adjuvant trastuzumab  with plans to continue 12 months  of 
therapy along with  tamoxifen.
11.July 3, 2017: bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy  for prophylactic purposes, given BRCA 
mutation.
12.September 23, 2017: patient develops severe headaches and nausea. MRI brain ordered.
13.September 25, 2017:  Brain MRI reveals 2 dominant brain metastases .
14.September 26, 2017: Neurosurgery consultation. Recommendation is for gamma knife 
surgery of two major lesions.
15.September 30, 2017: patient undergoes  gamma knife surgery .
16.October 15, 2017: systemic therapy changed to  ado-trastuzumab emtansine , with 
discontinuation of the previous plan of completing 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab.
17.February 20, 2018: evidence of  liver metastasis. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine discontinued, 
and systemic treatment changed to  capecitabine/lapatinib . Request for liver biopsy.
18.February 25, 2018: liver biopsy reveals metastatic breast cancer,  positive for PDL-1.
19.March 1, 2018: progressive disease in the liver and bones. Capecitabine/lapatinib stopped. 
Patient starts experimental pembrolizumab , as part of a clinical trial.
20.June 15, 2018: PET/CT scan after 3 months on pembrolizumab reveal a  complete 
radiographic response  to therapy.
35 yo premenopausal female with a BRCA mutation, diagnosed with node-positive, ER+, 
HER2+ right breast cancer. Treated with neoadjuvant dual HER2-directed therapy, followed 
by AC, with residual disease class I. Metastatic disease to the brain noted 4 months after 
surgery, treated with gamma knife, followed by ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Liver metastasis 
noted, treatment changed to capecitabine/lapatinib, with subsequent progression, and biopsy 
revealing PDL-1 positive disease, currently on pembrolizumab leading to a complete response.
