Based on the provided medical report, the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2, N0, M0) and has undergone cisplatin-based chemotherapy as primary treatment. The patient has moderate PD-L1 expression and no prior surgeries or radiation therapy. Considering these factors, I have identified the most relevant clinical trials for this patient.

1. **NCT05401279: Bladder Sparing Treatment of Tislelizumab Combined With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for Patients With PD-L1 Positive Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (T2-3N0M0): a Phase II Prospective Study**

This trial is a good match for the patient as it focuses on PD-L1 positive muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which aligns with the patient's moderate PD-L1 expression. The trial combines tislelizumab with gemcitabine and cisplatin, which are chemotherapy agents that have shown efficacy in bladder cancer. The expected outcome is a two-year bladder-intact disease-free survival rate.

Possible risks associated with this trial include:

* Adverse reactions to tislelizumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin
* Increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression
* Potential for worsening of pre-existing kidney disease

2. **NCT04960709: A Phase III Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Durvalumab in Combination With Tremelimumab and Enfortumab Vedotin or Durvalumab in Combination With Enfortumab Vedotin for Perioperative Treatment in Patients Ineligible for Cisplatin or Who Refuse Cisplatin Undergoing Radical Cystectomy for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (VOLGA)**

Although the patient is not explicitly stated to be ineligible for cisplatin or refusing cisplatin, this trial is still relevant as it focuses on muscle-invasive bladder cancer and combines durvalumab with other agents to enhance treatment efficacy. The expected outcome is event-free survival (EFS) compared to cystectomy.

Possible risks associated with this trial include:

* Adverse reactions to durvalumab, tremelimumab, and enfortumab vedotin
* Increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression
* Potential for worsening of pre-existing kidney disease

It is essential to note that the patient's current kidney function (GFR 60-70 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²) and stage 2 chronic kidney disease may impact their eligibility for these trials. The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored throughout the trial to prevent potential decline.

Before enrolling in any clinical trial, the patient should discuss the potential benefits and risks with their healthcare provider and carefully review the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria.
