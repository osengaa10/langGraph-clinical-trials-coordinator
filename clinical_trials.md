Based on the patient's medical report, I have found a few clinical trials that might be relevant for her condition. However, please note that the patient's current treatment with pembrolizumab, her metastatic disease to the brain and liver, and her prior therapies (THP-ddAC, T-DM1, pembro) might affect her eligibility for some of these trials.

1. **NCT05950945**: This trial is a Phase 3b, multicenter, global, interventional, open-label study of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) in subjects who have unresectable and/or metastatic HER2-low or HER2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 breast cancer (DESTINY-Breast15). Although the patient's HER2 status is IHC 2+ and FISH-positive, the trial allows patients with HER2 IHC 2+/ISH- status, which is close to the patient's HER2 status. The patient's prior treatment with pembrolizumab might be a concern, but it is not explicitly mentioned as an exclusion criterion.

Expected prognosis outcome: The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic HER2-low or HER2 IHC 0 breast cancer. The primary outcome is the time from the start of T-DXd to initiation of subsequent anticancer treatment (TTNT).

Possible risks associated: The trial mentions common adverse events associated with T-DXd, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Serious adverse events, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, have also been reported.

2. **NCT04090567**: This trial is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining Olaparib and Ceralasertib in patients with advanced/metastatic HER2-negative, BRCA germline mutation-positive breast cancer who have previously treated with a PARP inhibitor. The patient's BRCA1 mutation and prior treatment with pembrolizumab might make her eligible for this trial.

Expected prognosis outcome: The trial aims to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of Olaparib and Ceralasertib in patients with advanced/metastatic HER2-negative, BRCA germline mutation-positive breast cancer.

Possible risks associated: The trial mentions common adverse events associated with Olaparib and Ceralasertib, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Serious adverse events, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), have also been reported.

In conclusion, while both trials might be relevant for the patient, it is essential to carefully evaluate her eligibility and discuss the potential benefits and risks with her treating physician and the trial investigators.
