Based on the provided medical report, I've identified two clinical trials that may be suitable for the patient:

1. **NCT05316155: Phase 1 Study of Erdafitinib Intravesical Delivery System (TAR-210) in Participants With Non-Muscle-Invasive or Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer and Selected FGFR Mutations or Fusions**

This trial is a good fit for the patient due to the following reasons:

* The patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer and an FGFR3 mutation, which matches the trial's inclusion criteria.
* The trial is investigating the safety and efficacy of Erdafitinib, an FGFR inhibitor, which is a suitable treatment option for the patient given their mutation status.
* The trial allows for patients with stage 2 chronic kidney disease, which is consistent with the patient's medical history.

Expected outcome:
The primary outcome of this trial is to assess the safety of Erdafitinib, and the expected outcome for the patient would be to receive a treatment that targets their specific mutation, potentially leading to improved disease control and survival.

Possible risks:
The trial's exclusion criteria mention that participants with prior treatment with a pan-FGFR inhibitor are not eligible. However, this is not applicable to our patient. Other potential risks include adverse events related to the treatment, such as skin rash, nail changes, or eye problems, which are common side effects of FGFR inhibitors.

2. **NCT05544552: A Multicenter, Open-label Phase 1/2 Study of TYRA-300 in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With Activating FGFR3 Gene Alterations (SURF301)**

This trial may also be suitable for the patient due to the following reasons:

* The patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer and an FGFR3 mutation, which matches the trial's inclusion criteria.
* The trial is investigating the safety and efficacy of TYRA-300, an FGFR3-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is a suitable treatment option for the patient given their mutation status.

Expected outcome:
The primary outcome of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of TYRA-300, and the expected outcome for the patient would be to receive a treatment that targets their specific mutation, potentially leading to improved disease control and survival.

Possible risks:
The trial's exclusion criteria mention that participants with uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or active brain metastases are not eligible. However, this is not applicable to our patient. Other potential risks include adverse events related to the treatment, such as skin rash, nail changes, or eye problems, which are common side effects of FGFR inhibitors.

In conclusion, both trials (NCT05316155 and NCT05544552) may be suitable options for the patient, given their muscle-invasive bladder cancer and FGFR3 mutation. However, it's essential to carefully review the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as the potential risks and benefits, before making a final decision.
