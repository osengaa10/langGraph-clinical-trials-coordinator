Based on the patient's medical report, I have not retrieved any clinical trials yet. However, I will provide the most relevant search criteria to find clinical trials that match the patient's condition.

The most relevant clinical trials for this patient would be those that focus on muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with disease progression after initial chemotherapy. Given the patient's ECOG score of 2 and CKD with an eGFR of 45 mL/min, we should prioritize trials with lenient eligibility criteria regarding ECOG score and kidney function.

Here are some search criteria to find relevant clinical trials:

* Condition: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)
* Intervention: Novel agents or combination therapies (e.g., immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy)
* Inclusion criteria:
	+ Disease progression after initial chemotherapy
	+ ECOG score of 2 or lower
	+ Kidney function: eGFR of 45 mL/min or higher
* Exclusion criteria: Trials that require an ECOG score of 0 or 1, or an eGFR above 60 mL/min

Some potential keywords to search for clinical trials include:

* "NCT muscle-invasive bladder cancer"
* "NCT MIBC disease progression"
* "NCT bladder cancer immunotherapy"
* "NCT bladder cancer targeted therapy"
* "NCT bladder cancer chemotherapy"

I will continue to search for clinical trials that match these criteria and provide an update once relevant trials are found.
