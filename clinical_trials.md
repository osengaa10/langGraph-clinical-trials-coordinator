Based on the patient's medical report, the most relevant clinical trials are:

1. **NCT04917809**: A Phase 2 "Window of Opportunity" Trial of Targeted Therapy with Erdafitinib in Patients with Recurrent FGFR3-Altered Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.

This trial is relevant because the patient has a confirmed FGFR3 mutation and has undergone TURBT. The trial is also focused on preserving kidney function, which is a priority for the patient. However, the patient's stage 2 CKD may impact eligibility for this trial.

Expected outcome: The trial aims to evaluate the objective response rate at the time of TURBT/biopsy following treatment with erdafitinib.

Possible risks: The trial may involve adverse effects from erdafitinib, such as kidney damage, phosphorus and calcium imbalances, and eye toxicity.

2. **NCT05544552**: A Multicenter, Open-label Phase 1/2 Study of TYRA-300 in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With Activating FGFR3 Gene Alterations (SURF301).

This trial is relevant because the patient has a confirmed FGFR3 mutation and has undergone TURBT. The trial is also focused on treating advanced urothelial carcinoma, which is the patient's diagnosis.

Expected outcome: The trial aims to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (R2PD) of TYRA-300.

Possible risks: The trial may involve adverse effects from TYRA-300, such as kidney damage, phosphorus and calcium imbalances, and eye toxicity.

The other trials listed are not as relevant to the patient's specific condition and medical history. NCT05151341 is a diagnostic trial, and NCT04921553 is a registry study that is not specifically focused on FGFR3 mutations or urothelial carcinoma.

It's essential to note that the patient's stage 2 CKD may impact eligibility for these trials, and a thorough review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is necessary to ensure the patient's eligibility and safety.
