Based on the provided medical report, the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer with disease progression despite prior treatments, including pembrolizumab immunotherapy. The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45 mL/min.

After reviewing the retrieved clinical trials, I found the following trials that may be relevant for this patient:

1. **NCT03711032 (KEYNOTE-676)**: This is a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Although the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the trial's focus on pembrolizumab and the potential for BCG therapy might make it worth considering. However, the patient's prior treatment with pembrolizumab and their CKD may impact their eligibility.

2. **NCT04856189**: This is a Phase Ib/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of selinexor and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. The trial's focus on cisplatin-ineligible or cisplatin-refractory patients, including those with renal dysfunction, might make it relevant for this patient. Additionally, the trial's inclusion of pembrolizumab, which the patient has previously received, might not be an exclusion criterion in this case.

3. **Cadonilimab (AK104) Plus Nab-Paclitaxel trials**: There are two identical trials (one for metastatic bladder cancer and one for muscle-invasive bladder cancer) evaluating the combination of cadonilimab and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced bladder cancer. These trials might be relevant for this patient, as they do not specifically exclude patients with prior treatment with pembrolizumab or those with CKD. However, the trials' focus on first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease might impact the patient's eligibility.

It is essential to note that the patient's eligibility for these trials should be confirmed with the trial investigators or sponsors, as the provided information might not cover all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Additionally, the patient's medical history, current symptoms, and laboratory results should be thoroughly evaluated to determine the best course of treatment.
