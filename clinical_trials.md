Based on the provided medical report, I have identified two clinical trials that may be relevant for the patient with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and a confirmed FGFR3 point mutation.

1. **NCT04917809: A Phase 2 "Window of Opportunity" Trial of Targeted Therapy with Erdafitinib in Patients with Recurrent FGFR3-Altered Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer**

This trial may not be the best fit for this patient as it is focused on non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, it's worth discussing with the investigators to see if they would consider a patient with muscle-invasive disease.

Expected Outcome: The primary endpoint of this trial is the objective response rate at the time of TURBT/biopsy following treatment with erdafitinib. If the patient is eligible and enrolls in this trial, they may experience a complete or partial pathologic response to the treatment.

Possible Risks: The trial's exclusion criteria and potential risks associated with erdafitinib, such as eye toxicity, cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal disorders, should be carefully evaluated.

2. **NCT05544552: A Multicenter, Open-label Phase 1/2 Study of TYRA300 in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With Activating FGFR3 Gene Alterations (SURF301)**

This trial is more relevant to the patient's condition, as it includes advanced urothelial carcinoma and FGFR3 gene alterations.

Expected Outcome: The primary endpoint of this trial is the overall response rate (ORR) defined by RECIST v1.1. If the patient is eligible and enrolls in this trial, they may experience a complete or partial response to the treatment with TYRA-300.

Possible Risks: The trial's exclusion criteria and potential risks associated with TYRA-300, such as eye toxicity, cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal disorders, should be carefully evaluated.

It is essential to discuss the patient's eligibility and potential risks with the investigators of these trials and to carefully evaluate the inclusion and exclusion criteria before making a decision. Additionally, the patient's stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be taken into consideration when evaluating potential trial therapies and monitoring renal function.
