Based on the provided medical report, I did not find a clinical trial that is a good fit for this patient. However, I will provide an explanation of why each trial is not suitable.

1. **An Open Label, Phase 2 Study of Disitamab Vedotin Combined With Tislelizumab**: This trial is not suitable because the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but this trial is focused on high-risk non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma.

2. **Pilot Study of an IDO and PD-L1 Peptide Based Immune-Modulatory Therapeutic (IO102-IO103) in Combination With Pembrolizumab**: This trial is not suitable because the patient has MIBC, but this trial is focused on high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Additionally, the patient has already received pembrolizumab as part of their previous treatment.

3. **An Open ,Single Arm, Prospective, Phase II Clinical Study on the First-line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer With Cadonilimab(AK104) Plus Nab-Paclitaxel**: This trial is not suitable because the patient has already received systemic treatment (cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pembrolizumab) and this trial is focused on patients who have not received systemic treatment.

4. **An Open ,Single Arm, Prospective, Phase II Clinical Study on the First-line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer With Cadonilimab(AK104) Plus Nab-Paclitaxel**: This trial is the same as the previous one, so it is not suitable for the same reasons.

5. **Phase 2 Window of Opportunity Study of Pemigatinib in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Patients With Recurrent Low- or Intermediate-Risk Tumors**: This trial is not suitable because the patient has MIBC, but this trial is focused on non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Unfortunately, none of the provided trials are a good fit for this patient. It is possible that the patient may be eligible for other trials that are not listed here.
