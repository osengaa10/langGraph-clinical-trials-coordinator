Based on the provided medical report, the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with a high PD-L1 expression and has undergone prior treatments including TURBT, cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, and pembrolizumab immunotherapy. The patient has an ECOG performance status of 2 and is willing to participate in clinical trials.

After reviewing the retrieved clinical trials, I found the following trials to be relevant for the patient:

1. NCT05203913 - This is a Phase II clinical trial that investigates the combination of cadonilimab (AK104) and nab-paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The patient's high PD-L1 expression and prior pembrolizumab treatment make them a potential candidate for this trial.

2. NCT05756569 is not a good fit due to prior pembrolizumab treatment.

3. NCT04848519 is not a good fit due to prior pembrolizumab treatment.

4. NCT06009848 is not a good fit because it focuses on non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

5. NCT04579224 is a good fit, as it is a Phase III randomized trial that investigates eribulin (NSC #707389) with gemcitabine versus standard of care for the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma refractory to, or ineligible for, anti PD1/PDL1 therapy. The patient's prior pembrolizumab treatment and metastatic disease make them a potential candidate for this trial.

In summary, the most relevant clinical trials for this patient are NCT05203913 and NCT04579224.
