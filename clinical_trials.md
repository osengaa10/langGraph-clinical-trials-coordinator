Based on the patient's medical report, I have identified three clinical trials that may be relevant for them. Please note that the patient's suitability for each trial should be determined by a qualified healthcare professional.

**Trial 1: NCT06040762 - "Get Moving Trial"**

This Phase I/II trial focuses on home-based prehabilitation with exercise and education in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and upper tract urothelial cancer. The patient's medical report indicates that they have muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which aligns with the trial's inclusion criteria.

Expected outcome: The trial aims to improve physical function, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Possible risks: The trial involves exercise and physical activity, which may pose risks for patients with underlying medical conditions. Patients may experience muscle soreness, fatigue, or other exercise-related side effects.

**Trial 2: NCT06009848 - Cadonilimab (AK104) plus Nab-Paclitaxel for Recurrent or Metastatic Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer**

This Phase II trial investigates the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab (AK104) in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The patient's medical report indicates that they have muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which aligns with the trial's inclusion criteria.

Expected outcome: The trial aims to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of cadonilimab plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Possible risks: The trial involves the use of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, which may pose risks such as infusion reactions, immune-related adverse events, and hematological toxicities.

**Trial 3: NCT03914794 - Pemigatinib in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Patients With Recurrent Low- or Intermediate-Risk Tumors**

Although this Phase 2 trial focuses on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the patient's medical report indicates that they have muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, the trial's inclusion criteria do not explicitly exclude patients with muscle-invasive disease. A healthcare professional should determine the patient's suitability for this trial.

Expected outcome: The trial aims to evaluate the complete response rate of pemigatinib therapy in patients with recurrent low- or intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Possible risks: The trial involves the use of pemigatinib, which may pose risks such as gastrointestinal toxicities, skin toxicities, and changes in liver function tests.
