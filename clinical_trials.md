Based on the provided medical report, I found the following relevant clinical trials for the patient:

1.  NCT05239624 (Enfortumab Vedotin in Combination With Pembrolizumab for Locally Advanced and/or Node Positive Urothelial Carcinoma Prior to Surgery (EV-ECLIPSE)): This trial seems promising as it targets urothelial carcinoma, which aligns with the patient's diagnosis. The trial's inclusion criteria allow for patients with ECOG performance status 0-1, and the patient's ECOG score of 2 might be considered, but not ideal. The trial also requires adequate organ function, and the patient's eGFR of 45 mL/min might impact eligibility.

2.  NCT04848519 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors With or Without Propranolol Hydrochloride In Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma): This trial is relevant as it targets urothelial carcinoma and has a broader range of inclusion criteria, including ECOG performance status â‰¤2. However, the trial's focus on immune checkpoint inhibitors might be a concern given the patient's prior pembrolizumab treatment.

3.  NCT06225596 (A Randomized Open-Label Phase 2/3 Study of BT8009 as Monotherapy or in Combination in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer (Duravelo-2)): This trial is also relevant, but its focus on BT8009, a novel therapy, might be a concern due to the lack of established efficacy and safety data.

Trials NCT05248789 and NCT06414317 are not suitable for this patient due to their exclusion criteria and the patient's performance status.

Please note that the patient's eligibility for these trials should be confirmed by the trial investigators, considering the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for each trial.
