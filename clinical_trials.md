Based on the provided medical report, the most relevant clinical trials for this patient are:

1. **NCT06511648: A Phase 2, Open-label, Multi-centre, Multi-national Interventional Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Erdafitinib (ERDA) Monotherapy and Erdafitinib (ERDA) and Cetrelimab (CET) Combination as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Cisplatin-ineligible Patients With Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) Whose Tumours Express Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor ( FGFR ) Gene Alterations**

This trial is relevant because the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with a confirmed FGFR3 mutation, and the trial is specifically designed for patients with FGFR gene alterations. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib monotherapy and combination therapy with cetrelimab as neoadjuvant treatment in cisplatin-ineligible patients.

Expected outcome: The trial aims to determine the pathological complete response (pCR) and pathological downstaging response (<ypT2) in patients treated with erdafitinib monotherapy and combination therapy.

Possible risks: The trial may involve risks associated with erdafitinib and cetrelimab, such as adverse reactions, allergic reactions, and interactions with other medications.

2. **NCT05544552: A Multicenter, Open-label Phase 1/2 Study of TYRA300 in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With Activating FGFR3 Gene Alterations (SURF301)**

This trial is relevant because the patient has urothelial carcinoma with an FGFR3 gene mutation, and the trial is specifically designed for patients with activating FGFR3 gene alterations.

Expected outcome: The trial aims to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (R2PD) of TYRA300, as well as the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.

Possible risks: The trial may involve risks associated with TYRA300, such as adverse reactions, allergic reactions, and interactions with other medications.
