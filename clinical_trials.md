Based on the patient's medical report, I have identified two promising clinical trials that may be suitable for them.

**Trial 1: NCT05316155**

Title: Phase 1 Study of Erdafitinib Intravesical Delivery System (TAR-210) in Participants With Non-Muscle-Invasive or Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer and Selected FGFR Mutations or Fusions

This trial is a good fit for the patient because:

* The patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer, stage T2, high-grade, and an FGFR3 mutation, which aligns with the trial's eligibility criteria.
* The trial is investigating the safety and efficacy of Erdafitinib Intravesical Delivery System (TAR-210), which targets FGFR mutations, making it a relevant treatment option for the patient.

Expected outcome: The primary outcome of this trial is to assess the number of participants with adverse events (AEs), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the overall response rate (ORR).

Possible risks: The trial may involve risks associated with Erdafitinib Intravesical Delivery System, such as urinary tract infections, hematuria, and bladder spasms.

**Trial 2: NCT05567185**

Title: A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Tolerability, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of TAR-210 in Japanese Participants With Bladder Cancer and Selected FGFR Mutations or Fusions

This trial is also a good fit for the patient because:

* The patient has bladder cancer with an FGFR3 mutation, which aligns with the trial's eligibility criteria.
* The trial is investigating the safety and efficacy of TAR-210, which is similar to the Erdafitinib Intravesical Delivery System used in Trial 1.

Expected outcome: The primary outcome of this trial is to assess the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of TAR-210.

Possible risks: The trial may involve risks associated with TAR-210, such as urinary tract infections, hematuria, and bladder spasms.

It is essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks of these trials with the patient's healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.
