Based on the patient's medical report, I have found one clinical trial that may be relevant for them. The patient has Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) with an FGFR3 point mutation, and they are seeking an immunotherapy or precision medicine approach in a clinical trial.

The most relevant clinical trial for this patient is:

1. NCT05544552: A Multicenter, Open-label Phase 1/2 Study of TYRA300 in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With Activating FGFR3 Gene Alterations (SURF301)

This trial is studying the efficacy and safety of TYRA-300, an oral, novel potent FGFR3-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors with activating FGFR3 gene alterations. The trial is open-label, meaning that all patients will receive the study treatment, and it is a Phase 1/2 trial, meaning that it is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the treatment.

The expected outcome of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of TYRA-300 and to evaluate its efficacy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors with activating FGFR3 gene alterations.

The possible risks associated with this trial include eye toxicity, cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, females who are pregnant or breastfeeding and males who plan to father a child while enrolled in this study are excluded from participating.

It is essential to note that this trial is not specifically designed for patients with MIBC, but it does include patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, which may be relevant for this patient. However, the patient's medical report does not provide enough information to determine if they meet the eligibility criteria for this trial.

The other trials mentioned in the retrieved clinical trials are not relevant for this patient. NCT04917809 is a trial for patients with recurrent FGFR3-altered non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which does not match the patient's diagnosis of MIBC. NCT05151341 is a trial for the detection of bladder cancer using a urine analysis combining VisioCyt automated cytology and FGFR3 mutations, which is not a treatment trial.

In conclusion, NCT05544552 is the most relevant clinical trial for this patient, but it is essential to review the patient's medical report and the trial's eligibility criteria to determine if they are a good fit for the trial.
