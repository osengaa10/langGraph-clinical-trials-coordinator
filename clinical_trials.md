Based on the provided medical report, I have found two clinical trials that may be suitable for the patient:

1. **NCT05401279 - Bladder Sparing Treatment of Tislelizumab Combined With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for Patients With PD-L1 Positive Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (T2-3N0M0): a Phase II Prospective Study**

This trial is relevant because the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer, moderate PD-L1 expression, and is willing to participate in clinical trials. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for bladder-sparing treatment.

Expected outcome: The primary outcome is the two-year bladder-intact disease-free survival rate. The trial may offer an alternative to radical cystectomy, which the patient is willing to consider.

Possible risks: The trial involves chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which can cause side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and neuropathy. Additionally, there may be risks associated with the experimental treatment tislelizumab.

2. **NCT04960709 - A Phase III Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Durvalumab in Combination With Tremelimumab and Enfortumab Vedotin or Durvalumab in Combination With Enfortumab Vedotin for Perioperative Treatment in Patients Ineligible for Cisplatin or Who Refuse Cisplatin Undergoing Radical Cystectomy for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (VOLGA)**

This trial is relevant because the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is willing to consider radical cystectomy. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab and enfortumab vedotin or durvalumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin for perioperative treatment.

Expected outcome: The primary outcome is event-free survival (EFS) up to 3 years. The trial may offer an alternative to standard treatment for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin or refuse cisplatin.

Possible risks: The trial involves chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and surgery, which can cause side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and neuropathy. Additionally, there may be risks associated with the experimental treatments durvalumab, tremelimumab, and enfortumab vedotin.

The other trials mentioned do not seem to be a good fit for the patient based on their medical report. For example, NCT05843448 is for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and NCT02625961 is for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. NCT04579224 is for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, which is not the patient's current diagnosis.
