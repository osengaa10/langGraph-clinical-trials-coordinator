The patient's medical report indicates that they have muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and have undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by several cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. They have also received pembrolizumab immunotherapy, which provided temporary disease control. However, the patient is currently experiencing worsening symptoms and their performance status has declined.

Based on the provided clinical trials, the following trials may be relevant for this patient:

1. **A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo- and Active-comparator Controlled Clinical Study of Adjuvant V940 (mRNA-4157) Plus Pembrolizumab Versus Adjuvant Placebo Plus Pembrolizumab in Participants With High-risk Muscle-invasive Urothelial Carcinoma Post-radical Resection**

This trial may be relevant for the patient as it targets high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, which aligns with the patient's diagnosis. The trial also involves pembrolizumab, which the patient has already received, and V940, a novel mRNA-based therapy. However, the patient must have undergone radical resection, which is not mentioned in the medical report.

2. **A Phase 3, Randomized, Comparator-controlled Clinical Trial to Study the Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in Participants With High-risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (HR NMIBC)**

Although this trial targets high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which is not the patient's exact diagnosis, it involves pembrolizumab and BCG, which may be of interest to the patient. However, the patient would need to meet the trial's specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, which are not fully aligned with their medical report.

The other trials provided do not appear to be directly relevant to the patient's diagnosis and treatment history.

In conclusion, the most promising clinical trial for this patient is the Phase 2 trial of adjuvant V940 plus pembrolizumab, but the patient's eligibility would depend on their specific clinical circumstances and the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patient should be referred to a multidisciplinary team to discuss their care plan and potential treatment options, including clinical trials.
