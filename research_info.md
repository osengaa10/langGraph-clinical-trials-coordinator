Based on the provided medical report, the patient has muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with high PD-L1 expression and no FGFR3 mutations. The patient has undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine, and is currently receiving pembrolizumab immunotherapy.

After reviewing the retrieved clinical trials, I found the following trials to be relevant for this patient:

1. **A Prospective Phase II Study of Risk-stratification Based Bladder-sparing Modalities for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer After Chemotherapy Combined With PD-1 Antibody (Rebirth)**: This trial is a good match for the patient as it:
	* Focuses on bladder-sparing modalities for MIBC patients.
	* Includes PD-1 antibody treatment, which the patient is currently receiving (pembrolizumab).
	* Allows for chemotherapy combined with PD-1 antibody treatment, which aligns with the patient's treatment history.
	* Has an ECOG performance status of 0-2, which matches the patient's ECOG performance status of 1.
2. **A Phase 2, Open-label, Multi-centre, Multi-national Interventional Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Erdafitinib (ERDA) Monotherapy and Erdafitinib (ERDA) and Cetrelimab (CET) Combination as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Cisplatin-ineligible Patients With Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) Whose Tumours Express Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) Gene Alterations**: This trial might not be a perfect match since the patient does not have FGFR mutations, but it:
	* Focuses on MIBC patients, which aligns with the patient's diagnosis.
	* Includes a PD-1 antibody treatment (cetrelimab), which is similar to the patient's current treatment (pembrolizumab).
	* Has an ECOG performance status of 0-1, which is close to the patient's ECOG performance status of 1.

The other retrieved clinical trials do not match the patient's profile as well, either due to differences in treatment regimens or inclusion/exclusion criteria.

It is essential to note that the patient's eligibility for these trials should be further evaluated by the healthcare team and the trial investigators to ensure the best possible match.
