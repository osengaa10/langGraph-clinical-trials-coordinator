Based on the provided medical report and clinical trials, the most relevant clinical trial for this patient is:

**Pilot Study of an IDO and PD-L1 Peptide Based Immune-Modulatory Therapeutic (IO102-IO103) in Combination With Pembrolizumab for BCG-Unresponsive or Intolerant, Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer**

This trial is relevant because:

1. **BCG-unresponsive or intolerant**: The patient has undergone BCG therapy but still experiences persistent hematuria, indicating incomplete response to BCG therapy.
2. **Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer**: The patient has stage II urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, which is a type of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
3. **PD-L1 positivity**: The patient's tumor is positive for PD-L1, which is a target for the proposed treatment.
4. **No metastasis**: The patient's recent MRI results indicate no metastasis, which aligns with the trial's inclusion criteria.
5. **ECOG status 1**: The patient's ECOG status is 1, indicating mild symptoms, which meets the trial's inclusion criteria.

The trial's inclusion criteria, such as histologically confirmed high-risk NMIBC, maximally resected tumor, and life expectancy â‰¥ 6 months, also align with the patient's medical report.

However, it is essential to note that the patient's stage 2 hypertension and current management with lisinopril may require additional evaluation to ensure the patient meets the trial's inclusion criteria regarding uncontrolled concomitant disease.
