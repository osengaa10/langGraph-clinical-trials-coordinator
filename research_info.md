Based on the provided medical report, I've analyzed the patient's information and matched it with the eligibility criteria of the retrieved clinical trials. 

Unfortunately, none of the provided clinical trials perfectly match the patient's current medical status. However, I've found a few trials that might be relevant, but the patient would not be eligible due to certain exclusion criteria.

For example, the first clinical trial (Document(page_content='Title: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo- and Active-comparator Controlled Clinical Study of Adjuvant V940 (mRNA-4157) Plus Pembrolizumab Versus Adjuvant Placebo Plus Pembrolizumab in Participants With High-risk Muscle-invasive Urothelial Carcinoma Post-radical Resection...') excludes patients who have received prior systemic anticancer therapy, which the patient has (Pembrolizumab and chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine).

The second and third clinical trials (Document(page_content="Title: Pilot Study of an IDO and PD-L1 Peptide Based Immune-Modulatory Therapeutic (IO102-IO103) in Combination With Pembrolizumab for BCG-Unresponsive or Intolerant, Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer...") focus on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which does not match the patient's diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

The last clinical trial (Document(page_content="Title: An Open ,Single Arm, Prospective, Phase II Clinical Study on the First-line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer With Cadonilimab(AK104) Plus Nab-Paclitaxel...") is for patients with recurrent or metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer who have not received systemic treatment. The patient has already received pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, so they would not be eligible for this trial.

In conclusion, I haven't found a clinical trial that perfectly matches the patient's current medical status. However, it's essential to continue searching for trials, and the patient's doctor or a clinical trial navigator can help with this process.
