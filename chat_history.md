AI: You've come to see me today, can you please tell me, what seems to be the main medical issue you're experiencing, and what symptoms have led you to seek medical attention at this time?

User: i am a 49 year old with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: Have you had any prior treatments for your muscle-invasive bladder cancer, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, and if so, how did your body respond to those treatments?

User: 

AI: Can you tell me what stage your muscle-invasive bladder cancer was diagnosed at, and have you had any recent imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRI, to assess the extent of the cancer and check for any metastasis to other parts of your body?

User: Yes, I’ve undergone a few treatments for my muscle-invasive bladder cancer. I had transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor initially. After that, I received cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, which helped reduce the cancer for a while. However, after completing the chemotherapy, scans showed some remaining cancer cells, so I started on pembrolizumab immunotherapy. Unfortunately, the pembrolizumab hasn’t stabilized the cancer, and my symptoms have been worsening recently. I haven’t had radiation therapy yet, but I’m here to discuss what options are left, given that the current treatments haven’t been fully effective

AI: Have you experienced any significant side effects or toxicities from your previous treatments, such as kidney damage from the cisplatin or immune-related adverse events from the pembrolizumab, that could impact the suitability of certain clinical trials or treatment options?

User: Yes, I’ve experienced some side effects from my previous treatments. During cisplatin chemotherapy, my medical team closely monitored my kidney function due to my existing chronic kidney disease (CKD). While my kidney function remained stable overall, there were some concerns about increased creatinine levels, so hydration and protective measures were used throughout the treatment to prevent any major kidney damage. As for pembrolizumab, I’ve had mild immune-related side effects, such as joint pain and a skin rash, which were manageable with anti-inflammatory medications and topical creams. Fortunately, I haven’t experienced more serious immune-related toxicities, like colitis or thyroid dysfunction, but I’m aware that these side effects are possible with continued immunotherapy. Given my kidney issues and the side effects from immunotherapy, I understand that these could impact my eligibility for certain clinical trials or future treatment options

AI: Can you tell me more about the recent worsening of your symptoms - specifically, what changes have you noticed in terms of frequency, urgency, or pain associated with urination, and have you experienced any hematuria (blood in your urine) or other symptoms that are concerning to you?

User: Recently, I’ve noticed a significant worsening of my urinary symptoms. The frequency and urgency have both increased—I feel like I constantly need to urinate, even when my bladder isn’t full. This has become particularly disruptive at night, causing frequent wake-ups and making it hard to get proper rest. Along with that, I’ve had more episodes of hematuria (blood in my urine). The blood is more noticeable now than it was before, and it’s happening more often. I’m also dealing with pelvic pain, which has become more intense and constant. It’s a dull ache most of the time, but it flares up into sharper pain, especially when I urinate. These symptoms are becoming difficult to manage and have me worried about the possibility that the cancer is progressing. The pelvic pain, in particular, has been getting worse, which is concerning because it wasn’t as prominent before.

AI: Are there any metastatic sites that have been identified through imaging studies or other diagnostic tests, such as lymph nodes, bones, or other organs, that we should consider when evaluating potential clinical trials or future treatment options?

User: no other metastic sites

AI: Can you tell me about your current kidney function, specifically what is your current estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and what stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) you are currently classified as, as this information will be important in determining your eligibility for certain clinical trials?

User: My most recent lab results show that my estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is around 45 mL/min/1.73 m², which classifies me as having Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). My kidney function has been stable overall, but the combination of CKD and the treatments I’ve received, especially cisplatin, requires careful monitoring. My medical team has been closely watching my kidney function throughout my cancer treatment to ensure it doesn’t worsen. This stage of CKD could potentially impact my eligibility for certain clinical trials, particularly those that involve nephrotoxic treatments or require higher kidney function levels for safety reasons

AI: Have you experienced any changes in your overall performance status or ability to perform daily activities due to your worsening symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, or decreased mobility, that could impact your suitability for certain clinical trials or treatment options?

User: yes Fatigue, lost 10 lbs, limited mobility due to pelvic pain

AI: Have you noticed any changes in the characteristics of the pelvic pain you're experiencing, such as radiation to other areas like the lower back or thighs, or any triggers that seem to exacerbate the pain, like certain positions or activities?
