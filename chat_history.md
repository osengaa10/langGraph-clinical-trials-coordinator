User: Yes, I’ve undergone several treatments for my bladder cancer. I had transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor, followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, I started pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression. Unfortunately, despite these treatments, my recent scans show disease progression.

I haven’t undergone radiation therapy yet, but it might be an option moving forward. My healthcare team is also considering stronger pain management options to address the worsening pelvic pain.

AI: Can you please provide more information about your current performance status, such as your ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score, and also any significant comorbidities you may have, such as kidney or liver dysfunction?

User: My current ECOG performance status is 2, meaning I can perform basic self-care but am limited in more strenuous activities due to fatigue and pelvic pain.

I also have chronic kidney disease (CKD), with an eGFR of around 45 mL/min, which affects my kidney function. My liver function is normal, and I don’t have any other significant comorbidities. The CKD is a key factor in my treatment decisions and may impact my eligibility for certain clinical trials.

AI: Have you experienced any significant side effects from your previous treatments, such as pembrolizumab immunotherapy, that may impact your eligibility for future clinical trials or require special consideration during treatment?

User: Yes, during my treatment with pembrolizumab immunotherapy, I experienced mild joint pain and a skin rash, both of which were manageable with medications. I didn’t experience any severe immune-related adverse effects, such as colitis or thyroid dysfunction.

However, my fatigue worsened over time, and I had to adjust my daily activities accordingly. These side effects are mild but may require monitoring during future treatments or clinical trials. My chronic kidney disease (CKD) also requires careful consideration, especially for treatments that could affect kidney function.

AI: Can you please share the results of your most recent imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRI, including the specific locations and sizes of any metastatic lesions or tumor growth, as this information will be crucial in determining your eligibility for certain clinical trials?

User: My most recent CT scan, done about one month ago, showed that the primary tumor in my bladder has increased in size, indicating disease progression. However, there were no signs of metastasis to distant organs or lymph nodes. The tumor is still localized to the bladder, but it has become more invasive.

There were no metastatic lesions detected in other areas like the lungs, liver, or bones. This localized progression will be important in determining the next steps for treatment and eligibility for clinical trials.
