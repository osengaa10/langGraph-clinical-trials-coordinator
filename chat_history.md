User: I am a 48 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What stage and grade is your muscle invasive bladder cancer, and have you undergone any previous treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy?

User: My muscle-invasive bladder cancer is stage T2 and high-grade, meaning it has invaded the muscle layer of the bladder but hasn’t spread to distant organs.

I’ve undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor, followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, I started pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression. Unfortunately, the cancer has progressed despite these treatments, and I haven’t received radiation therapy yet.

AI: Can you please tell me more about the progression of the cancer, such as the date of progression, any changes in symptoms, and any new metastases or tumor sites that have developed?

User: The cancer progression was identified during a CT scan conducted about one month ago, which showed an increase in the size of the primary bladder tumor. There has been no evidence of new metastases or spread to distant organs, but the tumor has become more invasive locally.

Since the progression, I’ve experienced worsening pelvic pain, more frequent episodes of hematuria (blood in the urine), and increased urinary urgency. The fatigue has also intensified, affecting my ability to perform daily activities. These changes suggest the cancer is becoming more aggressive.

AI: What is your current performance status, using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale, and are you currently experiencing any other significant comorbidities or health issues that could impact your ability to participate in a clinical trial?

User: My current ECOG performance status is 2, meaning I can perform basic self-care but am limited in more physically demanding activities due to fatigue and pelvic pain.

As for comorbidities, I have chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an eGFR of around 45 mL/min, which could impact my eligibility for certain clinical trials, especially those involving nephrotoxic treatments. Other than CKD, I don’t have significant comorbidities like liver disease or heart conditions.
