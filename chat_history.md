AI: What is the primary medical issue you are currently experiencing, and how long have you been dealing with it?

User: I am a 49 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What is the current stage of your bladder cancer, and have you undergone any treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery?

User: 
My bladder cancer is stage T2.

I’ve undergone TURBT to remove the tumor but haven’t received chemotherapy or radiation therapy yet. We’re considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to my FGFR3 mutation.

AI: Have you experienced any significant side effects or complications from the TURBT procedure, and do you have any underlying medical conditions, such as kidney disease or cardiac issues, that could impact your eligibility for clinical trials or treatment options?

User: 
I didn’t experience any significant side effects or complications from the TURBT procedure.

I do have stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which could impact my eligibility for certain trials, especially those involving nephrotoxic treatments. I don’t have any cardiac issues or other major underlying conditions.

AI: Are you currently being treated by an oncologist, and if so, have they mentioned any specific FGFR-targeted therapies or clinical trials that they think you may be a good candidate for?

User: 
Yes, I’m currently being treated by an oncologist. They have discussed FGFR-targeted therapies, specifically erdafitinib, as a potential option due to my FGFR3 mutation. They’re also looking into relevant clinical trials that may offer additional treatment options.

AI: Have you had any previous genetic testing or molecular profiling on your tumor, and are there any specific concerns or preferences you have regarding your treatment options, such as quality of life or potential side effects?

User: 
Yes, I’ve had genetic testing and molecular profiling on my tumor, which confirmed the FGFR3 mutation.

Regarding treatment, my primary concerns are quality of life and managing potential side effects, especially considering my stage 2 CKD. I’m open to options that offer effective control of the cancer with minimal impact on kidney function and overall daily living.

AI: Have you had any recent imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRIs, to assess the extent of your bladder cancer and potential involvement of lymph nodes or other organs?

User: Yes, I’ve had recent CT scans to assess the extent of my bladder cancer. The imaging showed that the cancer is localized to the bladder with no involvement of lymph nodes or other organs.
