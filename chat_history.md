AI: Can you please describe your current medical issue or the symptoms you're experiencing?

User: I am a 50 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What is your current stage and grade of bladder cancer, and have you undergone any treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy?

User: My bladder cancer is stage T2 and high-grade, meaning it has invaded the muscle layer but hasn’t spread to distant organs. I’ve undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor, followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. After that, I started pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression, but recent imaging showed the cancer has progressed despite these treatments.

AI: Can you please tell me about your overall health and any other medical conditions you have, such as hypertension, diabetes, or a history of other cancers, that might impact your eligibility for clinical trials?

User: In addition to bladder cancer, I have chronic kidney disease (CKD), which has been stable but requires regular monitoring. I don’t have a history of other cancers, and I don’t have hypertension or diabetes. The CKD is the most significant comorbidity that could impact my eligibility for certain clinical trials, especially those involving nephrotoxic treatments.

AI: Have you experienced any significant side effects or toxicities from your previous treatments, particularly the chemotherapy and immunotherapy, that may be relevant for future treatment planning?

User: Yes, during cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, I experienced fatigue, nausea, and some mild peripheral neuropathy (tingling in my hands and feet). My kidney function was also closely monitored due to my chronic kidney disease (CKD), and while my creatinine levels increased slightly, they stayed within manageable levels. With pembrolizumab immunotherapy, I had mild joint pain and a skin rash, both of which were controlled with medications. I haven’t experienced severe immune-related toxicities, but the fatigue has been persistent. These side effects are important to consider when planning future treatments.

AI: Are there any specific types of treatments or clinical trials you are interested in or have heard about that you would like to explore further, such as targeted therapies, CAR-T cell therapies, or combination regimens?

User: I’m interested in exploring targeted therapies if there are any new options based on further genetic testing. I’ve heard about FGFR inhibitors, though I don’t have FGFR3 mutations, but I’d like to know if other mutations could make me eligible for similar treatments. I’m also open to combination regimens that might include immunotherapy with chemotherapy or other agents. CAR-T cell therapy is something I’m curious about, though I understand it’s more experimental for solid tumors like bladder cancer. I’m willing to consider clinical trials with innovative approaches, especially if they offer better management of the disease.
