User: I am a 52 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What stage and grade is your muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and have you undergone any treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy so far?

User: My bladder cancer is stage T2 and high-grade, meaning it has invaded the muscle layer of the bladder but hasn’t spread to distant organs.

I’ve undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor, followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, I started pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression, but recent scans showed disease progression despite these treatments. I haven’t had radiation therapy yet.

AI: What is your current performance status, and are you experiencing any significant symptoms or side effects from your previous treatments?

User: My current ECOG performance status is 2, meaning I can perform basic self-care but have limitations with more physically demanding activities due to fatigue and pelvic pain.

From my previous treatments, I’ve experienced persistent fatigue, some mild peripheral neuropathy from chemotherapy, and joint pain along with a skin rash from pembrolizumab. These symptoms have worsened recently with the progression of the cancer."

AI: Have you had any prior testing for genetic mutations, such as FGFR3 or ERCC2, that may be relevant to your bladder cancer, and are you open to additional testing if necessary?

User: Yes, I’ve had genetic testing, but no FGFR3 or ERCC2 mutations were identified. The main finding was high PD-L1 expression, which led to the use of pembrolizumab. I’m open to additional testing if necessary, especially if it could reveal other actionable mutations or help identify new treatment options.
