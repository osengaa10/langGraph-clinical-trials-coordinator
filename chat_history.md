AI: Can you please describe your current medical issue or the symptoms you're experiencing that led you to consider participating in a clinical trial?

User: I am a 50 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What stage and grade is your muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and have you received any prior treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery?

User: My muscle-invasive bladder cancer is stage T2 and high-grade.

I’ve undergone TURBT to remove the tumor, but I haven’t received chemotherapy or radiation therapy yet. We’re currently considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to my FGFR3 mutation.

AI: Have you undergone any molecular testing to confirm the presence and type of FGFR3 mutation, and do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications that may impact your eligibility for clinical trials?

User: Yes, I’ve had molecular testing that confirmed the presence of an FGFR3 point mutation.

I also have stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which could impact my eligibility for certain trials, especially those involving nephrotoxic treatments. I’m not currently on any medications that would interfere with potential trial therapies.

AI: Can you please share your current Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, which is a measure of your ability to perform daily activities, to help determine your suitability for certain clinical trials?

User: My current ECOG performance status is 1, indicating I can perform daily activities with minimal symptoms and only slight limitations.
