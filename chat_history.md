AI: Can you please describe your current medical issue or the symptoms you're experiencing that led you to consider participating in a clinical trial?

User: I am a 55 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What stage is your bladder cancer currently classified as, and have you received any prior treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy?

User: My bladder cancer is currently classified as stage T2.

I’ve undergone TURBT to remove the tumor but haven’t received chemotherapy or radiation therapy yet. We’re considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to my FGFR3 mutation.

AI: Have you experienced any significant side effects or complications following the TURBT procedure, and do you have any underlying medical conditions, such as kidney disease or cardiovascular disease?

User: I didn’t experience any significant side effects or complications following the TURBT procedure.

I do have stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which requires monitoring, especially when considering treatments that may impact kidney function. I don’t have any cardiovascular disease or other major conditions.

AI: Have you had any previous tests or assessments to evaluate the extent of your bladder cancer, such as CT scans or MRI scans, and what were the results of these tests?

User: 
Yes, I’ve had CT scans to evaluate the extent of my bladder cancer. The results showed the tumor was localized to the bladder, with no evidence of metastasis to other organs or lymph nodes.

AI: What are your current performance status and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, which will help assess your overall health and ability to tolerate potential treatments?

User: My current ECOG performance status is 1, meaning I’m able to carry out daily activities with minimal symptoms. I experience some mild fatigue and pelvic discomfort, but they don’t significantly limit my daily function.
