AI: Can you please describe your current medical issue or symptoms that are causing you concern? What brings you to see me today?

User: I am a 49 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What is the current stage and grade of your muscle invasive bladder cancer, and have you undergone any treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy so far?

User: My muscle-invasive bladder cancer is stage T2 and high-grade, meaning it has invaded the muscle layer but has not spread to distant organs.

I’ve undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor, followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, I started pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to high PD-L1 expression, but the cancer has progressed despite these treatments. I haven’t undergone radiation therapy yet.

AI: Can you please tell me about your overall performance status, such as your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, and if you have any significant comorbidities or allergies that may impact your eligibility for certain clinical trials?

User: My current ECOG performance status is 2, meaning I’m able to handle basic self-care but am limited in more strenuous activities due to fatigue and pelvic pain.

I have chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an eGFR of about 45 mL/min, which could impact my eligibility for some clinical trials, especially those involving treatments that are hard on the kidneys. I don’t have any significant allergies or other comorbidities like liver disease or heart conditions.

AI: Have you had any recent scans or tests, such as a CT scan or PET scan, to assess the current extent of your cancer and potential sites of metastasis?

User: Yes, I had a CT scan about one month ago, which showed that my bladder cancer has progressed. The primary tumor has increased in size, but there is no evidence of metastasis to other organs or distant sites. The cancer remains locally invasive within the bladder, but there are no new metastases or tumor sites outside the bladder at this time.

AI: What is your current level of interest in participating in a clinical trial, and are you open to considering trials that involve experimental treatments, such as CAR-T cell therapy or targeted therapies, or do you have a specific type of trial in mind?

User: I am open to any clinical trials that can improve my prognosis
