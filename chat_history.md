AI: Can you please describe your current medical issue or the symptoms you're experiencing?

User: I am a 49 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What is your current cancer stage and grade, and have you undergone any treatments for your muscle invasive bladder cancer so far, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy?

User: 
My bladder cancer is stage T2 and high-grade.

I’ve undergone TURBT to remove the tumor but haven’t received chemotherapy or radiation therapy yet. We’re considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to my FGFR3 mutation.

AI: Have you had any genetic testing or molecular profiling done to confirm the FGFR3 mutation, and do you have any other underlying medical conditions or take any medications that may impact your eligibility for clinical trials or interact with potential treatments?

User: Yes, I’ve had genetic testing and molecular profiling, which confirmed the presence of an FGFR3 point mutation.

I have stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which may impact eligibility for certain clinical trials or treatments, particularly those that are nephrotoxic. I’m not currently on any medications that would interact with potential treatments like FGFR-targeted therapy.

AI: Have you experienced any significant side effects or complications from the TURBT procedure, and are you currently experiencing any symptoms such as hematuria, dysuria, or flank pain?

User: I haven’t experienced any significant complications from the TURBT procedure.

Currently, I’m experiencing hematuria and mild dysuria, but no flank pain. These symptoms are manageable and being monitored.

AI: Have you discussed or considered participating in a clinical trial with your doctor, and are there any specific inclusion or exclusion criteria you're aware of that may be relevant to your eligibility for certain trials?

User: Yes, I’ve discussed participating in a clinical trial with my doctor.

Relevant Criteria:
Inclusion criteria: My confirmed FGFR3 mutation and measurable disease make me eligible for trials targeting FGFR inhibitors.
Exclusion criteria: My stage 2 CKD may exclude me from trials involving nephrotoxic treatments, so kidney function monitoring will be crucial.
I’m open to trials that align with my health status and treatment goals.
