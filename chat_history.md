AI: Can you please describe the primary medical issue or symptom that brought you here today, and how long have you been experiencing it?

User: I've been diagnosed with bladder cancer that's invaded the muscle wall. I've been experiencing symptoms like blood in my urine and frequent, painful urination for about four months. There hasn't been any sign of the cancer spreading to other organs.

AI: What treatments, if any, have you undergone for your bladder cancer so far, and what was the stage and grade of the cancer as determined by your most recent pathology report?

User: I’ve undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine. I’m also currently receiving immunotherapy with pembrolizumab due to high PD-L1 expression. According to my most recent pathology report, the cancer was classified as stage T2, meaning it has invaded the muscle layer of the bladder but hasn't spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant organs. The grade was high, indicating the cancer cells are aggressive and more likely to grow and spread quickly.

AI: Have you experienced any side effects or adverse reactions from the treatments you've undergone so far, such as cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy or pembrolizumab immunotherapy?

User: Yes, I’ve experienced several side effects from the treatments. With cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, the main side effects have been nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, though anti-nausea medications have helped manage this. I’ve also noticed some hair thinning and mild neuropathy, such as tingling in my fingers and toes, but nothing too severe so far. From pembrolizumab immunotherapy, I’ve had a few immune-related side effects, including mild skin rashes and joint pain. These were managed with topical treatments and anti-inflammatory medications. My healthcare team has been closely monitoring for any more serious side effects, especially immune-related ones, but so far, nothing has required stopping the treatment.

AI: We need more information. - More specific details about the patient's muscle-invasive bladder cancer, such as the current stage and any relevant biomarkers.
- A complete treatment history, including any previous surgeries, chemotherapies, or targeted therapies.
- Information about the patient's current performance status and any significant comorbidities.
- Details about the patient's preferences for treatment location and any specific requirements they may have.

This additional information is necessary to identify a clinical trial that is a good fit for the patient's specific needs and medical history.

User: Cancer Stage and Biomarkers: My bladder cancer is classified as stage T2, meaning it has invaded the muscle layer of the bladder but hasn't spread to lymph nodes or distant organs. High PD-L1 expression was identified, making me eligible for immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. No FGFR3 mutations were found.Complete Treatment History:I initially underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the visible tumor.This was followed by chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine, primarily aimed at killing remaining cancer cells.I’m currently receiving pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to the high PD-L1 expression, and this is ongoing.I have not received any targeted therapies or undergone a radical cystectomy as I’m currently pursuing bladder-sparing treatments.Current Performance Status and Comorbidities:My ECOG performance status is 1—I can perform most daily activities but with some limitations, mainly due to fatigue and treatment side effects.I don’t have any significant comorbidities, though I’m managing mild neuropathy and joint pain from treatments, both of which are controlled with medications.Treatment Preferences: I prefer a bladder-sparing approach for as long as it remains a viable option. Quality of life is a key concern, and I’d like to avoid treatments with severe side effects if possible. I’m open to exploring clinical trials and am willing to travel for treatment if needed, though I prefer locations that offer comprehensive care close to home. This information should help narrow down potential clinical trials that align with my current medical status and treatment goals.

AI: Can you please tell me more about your current response to pembrolizumab immunotherapy? Specifically, have you had any imaging studies or tumor assessments since starting pembrolizumab, and if so, what were the results?

User: Yes, I’ve had a couple of imaging studies since starting pembrolizumab immunotherapy. The most recent one, a CT scan, was conducted about two months into the treatment. The results showed stable disease, meaning there hasn’t been any significant growth or spread of the tumor. The cancer hasn’t shrunk substantially, but it also hasn’t progressed, which is a positive sign for now. My medical team is continuing to monitor the situation with periodic imaging, and we’ll reassess if there are any changes in the tumor size or if new symptoms develop. So far, pembrolizumab seems to be keeping the cancer in check.

AI: Are you currently experiencing any urinary symptoms, such as hematuria, frequency, or urgency, and if so, how have they changed since you started pembrolizumab immunotherapy?

User: Yes, I’m still experiencing some urinary symptoms, including frequency and urgency, though they’ve improved slightly since starting pembrolizumab. Before treatment, I had frequent episodes of hematuria (blood in the urine), but that has decreased significantly since the surgery and subsequent treatments. The urgency and frequency have also lessened somewhat, but they’re still present, especially at night, causing some sleep disruption. Overall, the symptoms are more manageable now than before, though not completely resolved
