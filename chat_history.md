AI: What seems to be the main reason you're seeking medical attention? What symptoms or health concerns are you experiencing?

User: I am a 49 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: Can you tell me more about your diagnosis, such as the stage and grade of your bladder cancer, and have you undergone any previous treatments or surgeries?

User: My bladder cancer is stage T2 and high-grade.

I’ve undergone TURBT to remove the tumor, but I haven’t had any additional treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. We’re currently considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to the presence of an FGFR3 mutation.

AI: Have you experienced any symptoms such as hematuria, urinary frequency, or pelvic pain since the TURBT procedure, and do you have any other underlying medical conditions?

User: Since the TURBT procedure, I’ve experienced hematuria, urinary frequency, and mild pelvic pain.

I also have stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is stable but requires monitoring, especially as I consider further treatment options.

AI: Have you discussed the potential risks and benefits of FGFR-targeted therapy with your oncologist, and are there any specific concerns or questions you have about this treatment option?

User: Yes, I’ve discussed the potential risks and benefits of FGFR-targeted therapy with my oncologist. My main concerns are the impact on kidney function, given my stage 2 CKD, and any side effects that could affect my quality of life. I want to ensure close monitoring of my kidney function and minimize any adverse effects that might interfere with daily activities.

AI: Have you had any previous or current medications that may interact with FGFR-targeted therapy, and are you willing to participate in a clinical trial that may provide closer monitoring and management of your kidney function and potential side effects?

User: I haven’t had any previous or current medications that would interact with FGFR-targeted therapy. I’m open to participating in a clinical trial, especially if it offers closer monitoring of my kidney function and potential side effects, which is a priority given my stage 2 CKD.
