User: I am a 49 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: What stage is your muscle invasive bladder cancer, and have you undergone any treatments or surgeries so far, such as a radical cystectomy or chemotherapy?

User: 
My muscle-invasive bladder cancer is Stage II (T2).

I’ve undergone TURBT to remove the tumor but haven’t had a radical cystectomy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy yet. We’re considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to my FGFR3 mutation.

AI: Have you undergone any genetic testing or tumor profiling to confirm the FGFR3 mutation, and do you have any other health conditions or allergies that might impact your eligibility for clinical trials or affect the choice of treatment?

User: Yes, I’ve undergone genetic testing and tumor profiling, which confirmed the presence of an FGFR3 point mutation.

I have stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which may impact eligibility for certain nephrotoxic treatments in clinical trials. I have no known allergies that would affect treatment choices.

AI: Can you please tell me about your current performance status, such as your ability to perform daily activities, and any limitations you may be experiencing due to your muscle invasive bladder cancer or stage 2 CKD?

User: 
My ECOG performance status is 1, meaning I can perform daily activities with minimal symptoms and only slight limitations.

Due to muscle-invasive bladder cancer, I experience mild hematuria, urinary frequency, and occasional pelvic discomfort, but these symptoms don’t significantly limit my daily function.

My stage 2 CKD is stable and hasn’t caused major limitations, though kidney function monitoring is a priority when considering treatment options.

AI: Have you experienced any significant weight loss or changes in your appetite due to your muscle invasive bladder cancer, and are there any upcoming scheduled appointments or treatments that may impact your availability for potential clinical trials?

User: I haven’t experienced any significant weight loss or changes in appetite due to my muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

and I do not have any upcoming appointments
