AI: Can you please describe your primary medical issue or the condition you are currently experiencing?

User: I am a 58 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: Can you please tell me about your current treatment plan, such as any surgeries, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy you have undergone or are currently undergoing for your muscle invasive bladder cancer?

User: My current treatment plan involves considering FGFR-targeted therapy due to my FGFR3 mutation.
Previous treatments:
I’ve undergone TURBT to remove the bladder tumor.
I haven’t received chemotherapy or radiation therapy yet, but these options remain on the table depending on how my treatment progresses with targeted therapy.

AI: What is your current Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, which is a measure of your ability to perform daily activities, and do you have any other medical conditions or allergies that could impact your treatment or interactions with the FGFR-targeted therapy?

User: 
My current ECOG performance status is 1, meaning I can perform daily activities with minimal symptoms.

I have stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which may affect my treatment options, particularly with nephrotoxic therapies. However, I don’t have any known allergies or other medical conditions that would interfere with FGFR-targeted therapy.

AI: Have you undergone any genetic testing to identify other potential biomarkers or mutations that could impact your treatment options, such as PD-L1 expression or tumor mutational burden?

User: Yes, I’ve undergone genetic testing, which confirmed the FGFR3 mutation. There was no significant PD-L1 expression or elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) identified. My treatment plan is primarily focused on the FGFR-targeted therapy due to the identified mutation.

AI: Have you experienced any complications or side effects from your previous TURBT procedure, and do you have any concerns or preferences regarding the potential side effects or quality of life impacts of the FGFR-targeted therapy?

User: I didn’t experience any significant complications or side effects from the TURBT procedure. Recovery was smooth, with only mild hematuria and urinary discomfort that resolved quickly.

Regarding FGFR-targeted therapy, my main concerns are potential kidney-related side effects due to my stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD). I’m also cautious about any side effects that could significantly impact my quality of life, such as fatigue or skin reactions, but I’m open to this therapy if it offers better outcomes with manageable side effects. Regular monitoring of kidney function will be important.

AI: Have you discussed the possibility of participating in a clinical trial for muscle-invasive bladder cancer with your healthcare provider, and are you interested in exploring this option?

User: Yes I am intereseted
