AI: You've come to see me today, can you please tell me what brought you here, what's been bothering you lately, and what's the main medical issue you're experiencing?

User: I am a 49 year old male and I have muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: Can you tell me about your current treatment plan for the muscle invasive bladder cancer, and what treatments you've already received, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy?

User: My current treatment plan for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIUC) involves pembrolizumab immunotherapy, which I’ve been receiving for several months. So far, the cancer has remained stable, and I’ve had no significant progression since starting this treatment. Previously, I underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the tumor. After surgery, I completed several cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine to target any remaining cancer cells. I haven’t had radiation therapy, as it wasn’t part of the initial treatment strategy. The decision to move forward with pembrolizumab came after the chemotherapy, particularly because of the high PD-L1 expression in my tumor, making immunotherapy a good option for me. Right now, my plan is to continue pembrolizumab, monitor my progress through imaging studies, and consider other treatments or clinical trials if necessary.

AI: Have you experienced any significant side effects or adverse reactions to pembrolizumab since starting the treatment, such as fatigue, skin reactions, or issues with your endocrine or immune system?

User: Fatigue: This has been persistent but manageable. I find it affects my energy levels throughout the day, but I’ve adjusted my routine to include more rest. Mild skin reactions: I developed mild rashes, which were treated with topical corticosteroids, and they’ve stayed under control since then. Joint pain: I’ve had some discomfort in my knees and hands, which is being managed with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen. So far, I haven’t experienced any significant endocrine issues or severe immune-related side effects like thyroid dysfunction, but my healthcare team is regularly monitoring my thyroid function and other key markers to catch any potential problems early. Overall, the side effects are manageable, and I continue to work with my team to keep them under control.

AI: Can you tell me more about your tumor's genetic mutations, specifically whether or not you've had any next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests or FoundationOne tests to identify any potential actionable mutations, such as FGFR3 or ERBB2 alterations, that might open up additional treatment options or clinical trials for you?

User: Yes, I’ve had next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing done on my tumor, but no actionable mutations like FGFR3 or ERBB2 alterations were identified. The testing mainly revealed high PD-L1 expression, which is why I’m currently receiving pembrolizumab immunotherapy. While NGS didn’t find other targetable mutations, my healthcare team is monitoring for new treatment options and potential clinical trials that could be based on my current tumor profile. I understand that certain genetic alterations, if found, could open up new avenues for targeted therapies or experimental treatments, so I’m open to additional testing if it becomes relevant.

AI: Can you tell me about your current performance status, specifically how the fatigue and joint pain from pembrolizumab are impacting your daily activities, and whether you're able to maintain your usual level of physical activity and independence?

User: I have ECOG status of 1 and I do experience mild fatigue and joint pain

AI: Have you had any recent imaging studies, such as CT scans or PET scans, to assess the current extent of your muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and if so, what were the results?

User: Yes, I had a CT scan about two months ago to assess the status of my muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The results showed stable disease, meaning there has been no significant growth or spread of the tumor since starting pembrolizumab. There were no signs of metastasis to other organs or lymph nodes. My healthcare team is continuing to monitor the situation with regular imaging, but for now, the cancer remains under control. I haven’t had a PET scan recently, but the CT scan has been sufficient to track my progress

AI: Are you willing and able to travel to a clinical trial site for regular visits and treatment, if a suitable trial is identified that matches your medical profile and is being conducted at a location that is not nearby your current residence?

User: I am willing to travel anywhere for a clinical trial

AI: Can you tell me about your current urinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, or hematuria, and whether they've changed or worsened since starting pembrolizumab treatment?

User: My current urinary symptoms include frequency and urgency, which have remained relatively stable since starting pembrolizumab. I haven’t noticed any significant worsening, but the urgency, especially at night, still disrupts my sleep occasionally. Hematuria (blood in the urine) has improved significantly, and I’ve had very few episodes since the surgery and starting treatment. Overall, the symptoms are more manageable now compared to before treatment, but they haven’t fully resolved.

AI: Have you experienced any changes in your kidney function or creatinine levels since starting pembrolizumab, and are you currently on any medications to manage kidney function or electrolyte imbalances?

User: So far, my kidney function and creatinine levels have remained stable since starting pembrolizumab. As I have chronic kidney disease (CKD), my healthcare team has been closely monitoring my renal function with regular blood tests. There haven't been any significant changes or worsening of kidney function related to the treatment. I am not currently on any specific medications to manage kidney function or electrolyte imbalances, but I continue to take precautions, including staying hydrated and avoiding nephrotoxic medications. My team is vigilant about monitoring for any potential kidney-related side effects, especially given my history of CKD.

AI: Can you confirm whether your muscle-invasive bladder cancer is classified as pure urothelial or if there are any other histological components present, such as squamous or glandular differentiation, as this may impact your eligibility for certain clinical trials?

User: My muscle-invasive bladder cancer has been classified as pure urothelial carcinoma with no additional histological components like squamous or glandular differentiation. This classification was confirmed through my pathology reports following the transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Understanding this helps in determining treatment options and eligibility for clinical trials that may be more targeted towards pure urothelial carcinoma.

AI: Have you experienced any changes in your cancer-related symptoms, such as pain or weight loss, since your cancer was classified as stable on pembrolizumab, or have these symptoms remained relatively consistent?

User: The symptoms of pembrolizumab have remained relatively consistent

AI: What is your current understanding of your prognosis and life expectancy, as discussed with your healthcare team, and how does this impact your treatment goals and preferences?

User: My healthcare team has explained that while muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIUC) is aggressive, the fact that my cancer hasn’t metastasized and is currently stable with pembrolizumab offers a hopeful outlook. However, the prognosis depends on how well the disease responds to ongoing treatments. There’s always uncertainty, but the current treatments are helping to control the disease. As for life expectancy, my team hasn’t provided a specific number, since it depends on how the cancer behaves moving forward. This uncertainty influences my treatment goals—my priority is to maintain a good quality of life while staying as proactive as possible with effective treatments. I’m open to exploring new options and clinical trials if needed, but I want to balance this with minimizing side effects to keep my daily life as normal as possible
