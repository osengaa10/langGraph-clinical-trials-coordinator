AI: What seems to be the primary medical issue you're experiencing, and how long have you been dealing with it?

User: I am a 49 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: Can you please tell me about your current treatment plan, including any surgeries, chemotherapies, or immunotherapies you've undergone or are currently undergoing for your muscle-invasive bladder cancer?

User: Here’s a summary of my current and past treatment plan for muscle-invasive bladder cancer Surgeries:I underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the visible tumor. This was the first step in my treatment to reduce the tumor burden. Chemotherapy: After surgery, I received cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, completing a total of 6 cycles. While the initial response was somewhat positive, with some tumor reduction, there was still residual disease, which led to further treatments. Immunotherapy: Due to the high PD-L1 expression in my tumor, I started pembrolizumab immunotherapy. I completed 4 cycles over the course of about 4 months. Unfortunately, despite the treatment, recent imaging has shown progression of the disease, indicating that pembrolizumab has not been effective in stabilizing the cancer. Current Status: I am not currently undergoing any active treatment, as we are assessing the next steps due to the progression of the disease. I’m exploring second-line chemotherapy options and clinical trials, as well as potential targeted therapies based on further genetic testing. At this stage, my goal is to find a more effective treatment strategy to manage the progression and improve my quality of life.

AI: Have you undergone any genetic testing or molecular profiling on your tumor to identify potential biomarkers or mutations that could help guide targeted therapy or clinical trial options?

User: Yes, I’ve undergone Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on my tumor, but no actionable mutations like FGFR3 or ERBB2 were found. The main finding was high PD-L1 expression, which led to the use of pembrolizumab immunotherapy. I haven’t undergone FoundationOne testing specifically, but I’m open to additional molecular profiling if it could reveal new targets for treatment or clinical trials.

AI: Can you please provide more information about your current symptoms, performance status, and any significant comorbidities or health conditions that could impact your eligibility for clinical trials or treatment options?

User: Currently, my main symptoms are increased urinary frequency and urgency, pelvic pain, and fatigue. I’ve also had hematuria (blood in the urine) more frequently in recent weeks. My ECOG performance status is 2, meaning I’m still able to perform basic self-care but am limited in more strenuous activities due to fatigue and pain. In terms of comorbidities, I have chronic kidney disease (CKD), which has been stable, though it requires close monitoring, especially when considering treatments like chemotherapy that may affect kidney function.

AI: Have you experienced any significant weight loss, loss of appetite, or other systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or night sweats, which could be related to the progression of your bladder cancer?

User: I have lost 10 pounds due to lack of appetite
