User: i am a 49 year old male with muscle invasive bladder cancer

AI: Can you please tell me about your current treatment plan, such as any surgeries, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy you've had or are scheduled for?

User: My current treatment plan has evolved as my bladder cancer has progressed. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve done so far and what’s next: Surgery: I previously underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the visible tumor. This was the initial surgical intervention for my muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Chemotherapy: After surgery, I completed several cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Initially, this helped reduce the tumor, but residual disease remained. Immunotherapy: I started pembrolizumab immunotherapy due to the high PD-L1 expression found in my tumor. Unfortunately, pembrolizumab has not been effective in stabilizing the cancer, and recent imaging confirmed disease progression. Current Status: I don’t have any scheduled surgeries or radiation therapy at the moment, but my medical team and I are discussing next steps, including potential second-line treatments or clinical trial options. I’m also considering new chemotherapy regimens or immunotherapy combinations, as well as any targeted therapies that might be suitable based on additional genetic testing or trial eligibility. At this point, I’m looking for the most effective strategy to manage the disease since my current treatments have not been successful.

AI: You mentioned additional genetic testing. Have you undergone any molecular profiling or genetic testing of your tumor, such as FoundationOne or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), to identify potential genetic mutations or alterations that could help guide targeted therapy or clinical trial options?

User:  Yes, I’ve undergone Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on my tumor to identify potential genetic mutations or alterations. Unfortunately, no actionable mutations like FGFR3 or ERBB2 were found. The main finding was high PD-L1 expression, which is why I was treated with pembrolizumab. I haven’t had FoundationOne testing specifically, but the NGS results didn’t reveal any significant genetic alterations that would open the door to targeted therapies. That said, I’m open to undergoing additional molecular profiling or genetic testing to explore any emerging treatment options or clinical trials that may target other mutations not previously identified. Given the progression of my cancer, further testing could provide new insights, and I’d like to explore this possibility to see if there are any novel therapies or experimental options available.

AI: Can you please provide more information about your current performance status, such as your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score or Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), as this will help determine your eligibility for certain clinical trials?

User: my ECOG score is 2

AI: Given your ECOG score of 2 and progressive disease despite standard treatments, are you open to participating in early-phase clinical trials (e.g., Phase I), which may involve experimental agents with limited data on efficacy and safety, or would you prefer to explore Phase II or III trials with more established agents?

User: I am open to any phase

AI: Can you provide more details about your chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine, such as the number of cycles, dosages, and any toxicities or side effects you experienced? Additionally, how long did you receive pembrolizumab immunotherapy, and were there any notable side effects or immune-related adverse events?

User: Certainly. Here are the details of my chemotherapy and pembrolizumab immunotherapy treatments: Chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Gemcitabine: I completed a total of 6 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine. Dosages: I received cisplatin at 70 mg/m² on day 1 of each cycle, and gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m² on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Toxicities and Side Effects: I experienced fatigue, which progressively worsened over the course of treatment. There were some mild episodes of nausea and vomiting, but these were managed with antiemetic medications. I developed peripheral neuropathy (tingling in my hands and feet), which persisted but was mild. My kidney function was monitored closely due to my chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hydration protocols were used to prevent further damage. My creatinine levels did increase slightly during treatment, but not to a level requiring dose reduction. I also experienced some anemia, which contributed to the fatigue. Pembrolizumab Immunotherapy: I was on pembrolizumab for about 4 months and completed 4 cycles. Notable Side Effects: I had mild immune-related side effects, including joint pain and a skin rash, which were managed with anti-inflammatory medications and topical corticosteroids. I experienced fatigue, which persisted throughout the treatment and may have been compounded by the prior chemotherapy. Fortunately, I didn’t experience any severe immune-related adverse events like colitis, pneumonitis, or thyroid dysfunction, but my team monitored my thyroid function and other immune-related markers regularly. Unfortunately, despite being on pembrolizumab, my cancer has progressed, and now I’m exploring further treatment options and potentially looking into clinical trials.

AI: What is your current liver function status, and have you experienced any liver-related issues or abnormalities during your previous treatments?

User: My liver function has been closely monitored throughout my treatments, and fortunately, I haven’t experienced any significant liver-related issues or abnormalities. My most recent liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, have all remained within normal ranges during both chemotherapy and pembrolizumab immunotherapy. There hasn’t been any indication of liver toxicity or dysfunction. Given that cisplatin and pembrolizumab can potentially impact liver function, my healthcare team has kept a close eye on these markers during treatment. So far, no liver-related toxicities have emerged, which is positive news as I consider additional treatments or clinical trial options that could also affect liver health.

AI: Have you considered or discussed with your healthcare team the possibility of a radical cystectomy (bladder removal surgery) as a treatment option, and if so, is this something you would be willing to consider or would you prefer to explore other alternatives?

User: Id like to keep my bladder

AI: To further verify your eligibility for clinical trials, can you please provide the specific NCT IDs of the trials you are considering, and also confirm whether these trials exclude patients who have previously received pembrolizumab? Additionally, are there any changes in your medical history or current health status that have occurred since your last medical report that I should be aware of?

User: I dont know of any nct ids. any thaat are a good fit for me

AI: I'd like to confirm your current treatment status and willingness to participate in a trial with a specific treatment combination. Considering your prior pembrolizumab treatment and current ECOG score of 2, I'd like to ask: Would you be interested in participating in a trial like **NCT04856189**, which combines Selinexor and Pembrolizumab, and if so, would you be willing to consider a trial that may have a similar treatment combination or a different one that targets your specific cancer type?

User: yes i would be willing
