AI: Can you please tell me what's been going on with your health that's brought you here today, and what are the main symptoms you've been experiencing?

User: Lately, my bladder cancer has not been responding well to pembrolizumab. Over the past couple of months, my symptoms have worsened. I’ve been experiencing increased urinary frequency and urgency, along with more frequent blood in my urine (hematuria). I’m also dealing with pelvic pain that wasn’t there before, and it’s becoming more persistent, especially at night. The fatigue has gotten worse, and I’m finding it harder to complete even basic daily tasks. I’m concerned that the cancer may be progressing, and I’m here to discuss next steps and possible alternative treatments.

AI: Can you tell me about your previous treatments for bladder cancer, before starting pembrolizumab? For example, did you have surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, and how did you respond to those treatments?

User: Surgery: I had a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove the visible tumor. The surgery went well, and they were able to remove most of the tumor, but the pathology showed it was muscle-invasive. Chemotherapy: After surgery, I had several cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy to target any remaining cancer cells. Initially, I responded well to the chemotherapy, with some reduction in the cancer, but after completing the cycles, scans showed residual disease, which led to the decision to start immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. I haven’t had radiation therapy so far, and until recently, the disease was somewhat controlled. However, now with pembrolizumab not stabilizing the cancer, I’m concerned about progression and what other options may be available.

AI: Have you noticed any significant changes in your overall performance status, such as weight loss, loss of appetite, or decreased mobility, that might be related to your bladder cancer progression or the worsening symptoms you've been experiencing?

User: Weight loss: I’ve unintentionally lost about 10 pounds over the past couple of months. My appetite has decreased, likely due to the increasing pelvic pain and general discomfort. Fatigue: The fatigue has worsened considerably, making it harder to complete daily tasks. I’m finding it difficult to stay active and need more rest than before. Mobility: While I’m still able to move around, the pelvic pain has started to limit my mobility. Walking or standing for extended periods causes discomfort, and I’ve had to cut back on certain physical activities. These changes have made it more challenging to maintain my usual routine, and I’m concerned that they may be related to the progression of my bladder cancer.
